<h3>
CHAPTER I.
<br /><br />
A LAKE HURON "HUMMER."
</h3>

<p>
"Looks as if it might be blowing up for nasty
weather, Tom."
</p>

<p>
Jack Dacre, the younger of the Bungalow
Boys, spoke, as his head emerged from the
engine room hatchway of the sixty-foot,
motor-driven craft, <i>Sea Ranger</i>.
</p>

<p>
Tom nodded, and spun the spokes of the steering
wheel ever so little.  The <i>Sea Ranger</i>
responded by heading up a trifle more into the seas,
which were already growing threatening.
</p>

<p>
"I've been thinking the same thing for some
time," he said presently.  "If Alpena wasn't so
far behind us, I'd turn back now."
</p>

<p>
"We can't be more than three miles off shore.
Why not head in toward it?"
</p>

<p>
The elder Dacre boy shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"Don't know the coast," he said; "and it's a
treacherous one."
</p>

<p>
The sky, cloudless but a short time before, was
now heavily overcast.  To the northwest, black,
angry-looking clouds were banked in castellated
masses.  Their ragged edges would have shown
a trained eye that, as sailors say, "there was
wind behind them."
</p>

<p>
The waters of Lake Huron, recently sparkling
under the bright sun, were now of a dull, leaden
hue.  The long water rows began to rise sullenly
in heaving billows, over the crests of which
the <i>Sea Ranger</i> plunged and wallowed.
</p>

<p>
"What are we going to do?" asked Jack presently,
after an interval in which both brothers
rather anxiously inspected the signs of "dirty
weather."
</p>

<p>
"How are your engines working?" was Tom's
way of answering with another question.
</p>

<p>
"Splendidly; as they have done ever since we
left New York.  I'm not anxious about them."
</p>

<p>
"Then we'll keep right on as we are.  It would
be risky to turn back to Thunder Bay now.  The
<i>Sea Ranger</i> is stanch.  We saw to that before
we chartered her.  She will weather it, all right."
</p>

<p>
"I guess you're right.  But I can see here and
now that our camping cruise isn't going to be all
fun.  These Lake Huron storms have a bad
reputation.  When we were down off Florida, old
Captain Pangloss said that they were as bad as
anything he had encountered, even in the China
seas."
</p>

<p>
"At any rate, that trip taught us a lot about
boat-handling," said Tom, "and other things,
too," he added, with a rather grim smile, as he
recalled the stirring times they had had on the
voyage referred to.  Those adventures were all
set forth in full in <i>The Bungalow Boys Marooned
in the Tropics</i>.
</p>

<p>
"They sure did," agreed the younger Dacre.
"The weather looked like this off Hatteras,
before the time we beat out Dampier and Captain
Walstein in the search for the sunken treasure-ship."
</p>

<p>
"And thereby helped to get large enough bank
accounts to plan this trip," interpolated Tom.
"By the way, I wonder whatever became of those
two rascals after their escape from jail?"
</p>

<p>
"The papers said that they were supposed to
have made their way to Canada.  But nobody
knows for certain."
</p>

<p>
While he spoke, the sea was growing more and
more turbulent.
</p>

<p>
"I'll go below and rouse up Sandy and Professor
Podsnap.  We want to have everything secure
and snug in the cabin before the storm hits
us."
</p>

<p>
Jack found the professor and Sandy deep in a
game of chess.  One, at least, of the players,
namely Sandy, was not sorry to have the game
broken up.  The professor had his hand poised
above his bishop, and was about to make a move
that would speedily have checkmated the Scotch
youth, when Jack burst into the cabin.
</p>

<p>
They had been so interested in the game that
they had not noticed the increased motion of
the <i>Sea Ranger</i>.  But, as Professor Podsnap
leaped to his feet, when Jack rapidly made them
aware of the situation, the bald-headed professor
went sliding off to leeward across the cabin
floor.  An unusually heavy lurch had propelled
him, and his speed was great.
</p>

<p>
To save his angular form from an ignominious
tumble, he clutched at the cloth on the cabin
table.  As might have been expected, it did not
prove a substantial support.  Before either of
the boys could interfere, the professor was in a
heap on the floor, struggling blindly to extricate
himself from the folds of the drapery which
enveloped him.  Struggling to check their laughter,
the boys rescued him.  But their subdued
mirth broke into a loud shout as they beheld the
professor's countenance.  A bottle of ink had
been standing on the table, and its contents were
now spilled in black rivulets all over the professor's
face.  His bony features fairly streamed
with the black fluid, while his spectacles hung
suspended from one ear, in a most undignified
manner.
</p>

<p>
He gazed about him in a bewildered fashion,
as he scrambled to his feet.  He made such a
comical sight that the boys, in spite of their
respect for his learning and age, could no longer
check their merriment at the ludicrous figure, and
they laughed till the tears ran down their cheeks,
only stopping to gasp out apologies and then go
off into more paroxysms of mirth.
</p>

<p>
"The sea&mdash;as someone has observed&mdash;is no respecter
of persons," observed the professor, wiping
the ink in long smudges with his pocket handkerchief.
</p>

<p>
"Of parsons, sir?" inquired Sandy.
</p>

<p>
"Of persons," said the professor solemnly.
</p>

<p>
"Which reminds me," said Jack, controlling
his laughter and rapidly describing to the
professor and Sandy the condition of things outside.
They at once set to work securing everything
movable.  The professor didn't even take time to
clean his face.
</p>

<p>
In the meantime, Jack had returned to the deck,
passing through the engine room on his way.
The <i>Sea Ranger</i> was driven by a powerful
forty-horsepower, six-cylinder, gasolene engine.  The
boy paused only to ascertain that everything was
in good order before he rejoined Tom, who
stood on a sort of bridge amidships.
</p>

<p>
Even in the short time he had been below, the
weather had noticeably roughened.  It was almost
dark.
</p>

<p>
"What time is it?" inquired Jack, as he gained
Tom's side.  The other drew out his watch.
</p>

<p>
"Only a little after five.  But it's getting as
dark as if it were three hours later."
</p>

<p>
"It certainly is.  We are in for a hummer, all
right."
</p>

<p>
"Don't make any mistake about that."
</p>

<p>
The rising wind began to scream about the
laboring craft.  Whitecaps flecked the
lead-colored waves.  The sky was overshadowed by a
dark canopy of clouds.
</p>

<p>
Across the tempest-lashed waters, Tom, by
straining his eyes, could manage to make out a
dark point of land.
</p>

<p>
"That ought to be Dead Fish Point," he observed
to Jack.  "But I couldn't be sure unless I
saw the light."
</p>

<p>
"What kind of a light is it?" asked Jack.
</p>

<p>
"White and red, in one-minute flashes, I
looked it up on the chart before we left Thunder
Bay."
</p>

<p>
"Well, they ought to light up now.  It's dark
enough," opined Jack.  "By the way," he went
on, "wasn't it from that lighthouse that they
drove off the gang that has been wrecking
vessels by displaying false lights?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  The men visited the light just as an
increased force of lighthouse keepers had been
put on, owing to the number of wrecks that have
happened recently from the operations of this
gang.  They were driven off.  But they had a
swift tug and escaped.  The authorities have been
looking for them since."
</p>

<p>
"If the newspapers are right, it is the same
outfit that has been operating on all the Great
Lakes."
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  It's a new and up-to-date method of
piracy, as the police claim.  The gang engaged
in it wrecks vessels by means of changing or
extinguishing lights, and then raids the cargo.  It
is dastardly business!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I should say so!"
</p>

<p>
At this point the professor and Sandy came on
deck.
</p>

<p>
"Hoot mon!" exclaimed the Scotch youth, "it's
as dark as an unco' dark tunnel."
</p>

<p>
"It resembles midnight," put in the professor,
who had, by this time, removed the traces of his
encounter with the ink bottle.
</p>

<p>
The four, who were the only ones on board the
<i>Sea Ranger</i>, stood side by side on the bridge,
holding tightly to the hand-rail to avoid being
thrown off their feet.
</p>

<p>
"D'ye ken if it'ull get wurss?" asked Sandy
presently.
</p>

<p>
"It will get worse before it gets better," was
Tom's pithy rejoinder.
</p>

<p>
The <i>Sea Ranger</i> had set out from New York
three weeks before.  Her destination was a small
island situated in the Mackinac Straits, called
Castle Rock Island.  The trip was in the nature
of a holiday outing following the Bungalow Boys'
trying experiences with the Chinese smugglers,
as related in The <i>Bungalow Boys in the Great
Northwest</i>.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Chisholm Dacre, the Bungalow Boys'
uncle, with the mystery of whose life the first
volume of this series&mdash;<i>The Bungalow Boys</i>&mdash;was
concerned, had decided, after some persuasion, to
allow the lads to go.  It had been a trip which
they had often longed to take.  Mr. Dacre and the
parents of Sandy MacTavish, whose father was
a wealthy importer, agreed that a vacation cruise
would do the lads no harm after their really
trying experiences in the hands of Simon Lake.
</p>

<p>
The <i>Sea Ranger</i> had, therefore, been chartered,
being a suitable craft for the expedition.
Mr. MacTavish, who had a partial claim to Castle
Rock Island, had permitted the boys to make it
their rendezvous.  They meant to use it as a sort
of headquarters during their stay on the Great
Lakes.
</p>

<p>
Well provisioned, and manned by as happy a
crew as ever left New York harbor, the <i>Sea
Ranger</i> had set out on her long trip through
the Hudson River and through the canals, to
Buffalo.  From Buffalo, they voyaged by easy
stages to Detroit, and thence to Port Huron.
Till that afternoon when they had started on the
last "leg" of their cruise, from Alpena, on
Thunder Bay, they had not encountered any but
ordinary incidents of travel.  Now, however, it
looked as if they were going to have an unpleasant
change.  But all the lads were adventurous
and daring, and the prospect of a lively blow did
not scare them.
</p>

<p>
A word of explanation is necessary in regard
to Professor Podsnap's presence on the <i>Sea
Ranger</i>.  Two days before she had sailed from
New York, the professor, whom the boys and
Mr. Dacre had rescued from a drifting raft in
Florida waters, appeared at the lads' home.  He
was about to start out on an expedition in search
of Indian relics.  By a strange chance, Lake
Huron was to form part of his hunting ground.
Mr. Dacre, deeming it a good thing to have an
elder person along with the boys, had responded
to the professor's somewhat broad hints by
inviting him to join his nephews.  As for the boys,
they respected the professor's learning, and had a
genuine liking for him, even if his eccentric ways
did, at times, amuse them.
</p>

<p>
And now, what had promised to be a tame
voyage, suddenly became fraught with excitement.
</p>

<p>
"Hold hard, everybody!" cried Tom suddenly.
</p>

<p>
He had seen a white wall of water sweeping
down toward the <i>Sea Ranger</i>.  The full fury of
the storm was about to burst upon them.
</p>

<p>
"Here she comes!" yelled Jack, as the howling
wind rushed down on them as if it would rend
them apart.
</p>

<p>
This was the beginning of a storm which
endured through the night, and which was to
have a curious influence on the strange events
which lay in the Bungalow Boys' future.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap02"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER II.
<br /><br />
LOST OVERBOARD!
</h3>

<p>
"This is the worst yet!"
</p>

<p>
Tom fairly shouted the words at Jack, who
stood by him on the bridge of the storm-tossed
<i>Sea Ranger</i>.  The younger lad had just come
from below, where he had deluged the engines
with oil.  He had also gone over them carefully,
although the way the little craft was pitching
made the job a difficult one.  But Jack knew that
the safety of the boat might depend on the way
the engines kept at work.
</p>

<p>
"I never saw anything like it," yelled Jack,
forming his hands into a funnel to make his voice
carry.  "Is it letting up at all?"
</p>

<p>
"Not a bit.  It is worse, if anything."
</p>

<p>
Tom peered into the gloom ahead.  But he
could see nothing but angry breakers, their white
tops whipped off by the furious wind and sent
scattering as they formed.  Both boys wore
oilskins and sou'westers.  The spray had drenched
them till their garments shone in the gleam of the
binnacle lamp.
</p>

<p>
"Better switch on the side and head lights,"
observed Tom presently.
</p>

<p>
He turned a button, and the red port light and
its green companion on the starboard side were
presently gleaming out.  Above them, on the
short mast with which the <i>Sea Ranger</i> was
equipped, there beamed a white light, and another
lantern of the same variety now shone out astern.
All were lighted by electricity, furnished from a
dynamo in the engine room, so that no matter
how hard the wind blew, or how high the spray
flew, there was no danger of their being extinguished.
</p>

<p>
"I feel a little better now," said Tom, after a
while.  "There's less danger of anything running
into us in this smother.  What are the professor
and Sandy doing?"
</p>

<p>
"Trying to get a cup of hot coffee, but not
succeeding very well.  There's too much motion
below, to stand still without gripping on to
something."
</p>

<p>
"Are we keeping a straight course?"
</p>

<p>
It was Jack who spoke, after another interval
in which the wind howled and the waves arose
still more menacingly.
</p>

<p>
"As straight as I can steer her in this.  I tell
you, it's hard work to hold the wheel at all."
</p>

<p>
Indeed, every time a wave buffeted the <i>Sea
Ranger's</i> rudder, it appeared as if the steering
wheel was about to be jerked out of Tom's hand.
But the elder Dacre boy possessed muscles
well-hardened by all kinds of athletic games, and he
stubbornly held the laboring craft to her course,
despite the storm.
</p>

<p>
"I'll go below and oil up again," announced
Jack presently.
</p>

<p>
He clawed his way across the bridge and
vanished into the engine room.  It was a wonderful
contrast down there, in the warm, dry motor
room, with the brightly polished machinery,
working and moving in as rhythmic and unconcerned
a fashion as if it was a summer's afternoon
without.  Incandescent globes made the place as
bright as day, and the brass and steel flashed as
it rose and fell with hardly any noise.
</p>

<p>
Oil-can in hand, Jack went his rounds.  He
poked the long spout in here and there, and then
paused to wipe his hands on a bit of waste.
</p>

<p>
"I wish we were out of this," he was saying.
"I wish we&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
There came a sudden, inexplicable jar throughout
the whole structure of the <i>Sea Ranger</i>.  Jack
was flung flat on his back.  The engines began to
roar and race furiously.  Every beam and rivet in
her frame seemed to vibrate.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Something terrible has happened," was the
thought that flashed through the lad's mind, as
he picked himself up.
</p>

<p>
He rushed out on deck as soon as he could
collect his scattered senses.  The wind was still
screaming angrily, and the riotous sea was
leaping all about the <i>Sea Ranger</i>.
</p>

<p>
But above the turmoil of the storm, Jack
caught a startling cry that came through the
darkness.
</p>

<p>
"Help!"
</p>

<p>
"Tom's voice!" exclaimed the lad.
</p>

<p>
He stumbled across the heaving deck and
rushed up the two steps that led to the bridge
where he had left his brother at the wheel.  His
pulses were throbbing wildly.  The next moment,
he, too, uttered a cry.
</p>

<p>
The bridge was vacant!  Tom had vanished!
</p>

<p>
"Help!  Help!"
</p>

<p>
The shout came once more.  But it was fainter
this time.  Jack gazed about him despairingly.
Tom was overboard, that much was certain.  But
how had it happened?  How&mdash;&mdash;?
</p>

<p>
"Put your helm over there!" roared a voice
out of the blackness&mdash;a harsh, hoarse voice, that
cut the storm like a vessel's siren.
</p>

<p>
Jack, only half-conscious of what he was doing,
spun the spokes over.  He was just in time.  Dead
ahead of their craft a larger vessel loomed up
for an instant.  She carried no lights, and a
glimpse was all Jack had of her.  But it gave him
a clue as to what had occurred.  In the darkness
they must have collided with the lightless
craft, and only his quickness in getting the helm
over had averted a second collision, which might
have proved disastrous.
</p>

<p>
"What is it?  What has happened?" came a
voice behind him.
</p>

<p>
It was the professor.  The binnacle light shone
on his gaunt, alarmed features.  Close behind
him pressed Sandy.
</p>

<p>
"Hoots, toots!" exclaimed the Scotch lad.
"What was the gr-r-r-r-and bo-o-omp?"
</p>

<p>
"We collided with a vessel without lights,"
gasped Jack, "and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;" his voice choked
up, "Tom's gone."
</p>

<p>
"Gone!" exclaimed the professor.  "Overboard,
you mean?"
</p>

<p>
Jack mournfully replied in the affirmative.
But he launched into action, too.
</p>

<p>
The switch that controlled the <i>Sea Ranger's</i>
powerful searchlight was handy to the wheel.
A quick twist of his wrist, and a white shaft of
light from the powerful reflector cut through the
night like a scimitar of flame.
</p>

<p>
With his hand on the controlling lever, Jack
swept the beams hither and thither through the
blackness.  In the meantime, Sandy had cut
loose one of the two patent buoys that were
lashed to the little craft's bridge.  He cast it
out from the <i>Sea Ranger's</i> side with a powerful
impetus.
</p>

<p>
As it struck the water, the dampness reached
the bottle of chemicals attached to the life-saving
contrivance.  Instantaneously a dull, ghostly
glare lit up the surrounding waves.  The light
was blue and uncanny, and rendered the scene
still more disheartening.  As the light struck the
tossing waves, it turned them to a steely,
unearthly bluish hue.
</p>

<p>
But if Tom were swimming anywhere near at
hand he would be able to see the buoy and strike
out for it.
</p>

<p>
"Look!  Look there!" cried the professor,
suddenly pointing off into the blue glare of the
chemical buoy.
</p>

<p>
The others hastily glanced in the direction
indicated, and, for a second, they could see a head
bobbing about on the wave crests.
</p>

<p>
"Turn the ship ar-oond!" bellowed Sandy.
</p>

<p>
"I daren't.  If we got into the trough of those
seas, we'd be swamped in an instant."
</p>

<p>
Jack spoke the truth.  To have attempted to
turn the <i>Sea Ranger</i> in the sea that was
running might have meant disaster, swift and
certain.
</p>

<p>
"There comes the other craft!" cried Jack suddenly.
</p>

<p>
As he spoke, he saw a large tug, pitching and
heaving fearfully in the heavy sea, come wallowing
into the circle of light cast by the chemical
buoy.  Several men were on her decks.  Jack
could see that one of them held a line, which he
threw out toward the bobbing head on the wave
crests.
</p>

<p>
<a id="p26"></a>
With the idea of aiding the men on the tug
in their work, Jack switched the searchlight over
toward them.  Its rays fell on the craft just in
time for those on board the <i>Sea Ranger</i> to see
Tom's limp form being hauled on board.
</p>

<p>
The brilliant rays of the searchlight lit up the
faces of Tom's rescuers as plain as day.  As it
fell on the wild, dripping countenances of the
tug-boat men, Jack gave a sudden start.
</p>

<p>
"Great Scott!" he burst out.  "Can it be possible?"
</p>

<p>
"Hoots!  Can what be possible, mon?" queried
Sandy.
</p>

<p>
"Why, look!  Look there!"
</p>

<p>
"At what, pray?  I see that they've rescued
poor Tom."
</p>

<p>
"No&mdash;I mean look at that man&mdash;the one there
by the pilot-house.  And the other beside him!"
</p>

<p>
"What in the name of the haunted kirk of
Alloway are ye speekin' aboot, noo'?" inquired
the Scotch boy.
</p>

<p>
"Why, those men.  It's Dampier and Captain
Walstein, just as sure as we are on this
bridge&mdash;and&mdash;and Tom is in their power!"
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap03"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER III.
<br /><br />
TOM ENCOUNTERS SOME OLD FOES.
</h3>

<p>
"Let us thank Providence he is saved."
</p>

<p>
It was the professor who spoke.  His words
made a deep impression upon Jack.  After all, it
might only have been his fancy.  It seemed like
a wild dream to imagine that Dampier and
Walstein could have&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
A sudden deluge of brilliant light encompassed
those on the bridge of the tossing <i>Sea Ranger</i>.
It was the searchlight from the hitherto lightless
tug.  For an instant the brilliant effulgence
bathed them, and then it vanished as suddenly as
it had appeared.
</p>

<p>
While they were still wondering what could
have been the reason of the sudden illumination,
there was a crash right above Jack's head, and a
shower of glass fell about him.  At the same
instant, above the screaming of the storm, could be
heard the sharp report of a firearm of some
kind.
</p>

<p>
The men on the tug, for some inscrutable reason,
had seen fit to shiver the <i>Sea Ranger's</i>
searchlight with a bullet.
</p>

<p>
"It wasn't any mistake of mine," flashed out
Jack; "nobody but Dampier or Walstein would
have been guilty of such a trick."
</p>

<p>
Evidently those on the tug were not anxious
to be observed.  The mere fact that they risked
being abroad without lights on such a night
showed that.  The shivering of the <i>Sea Ranger's</i>
searchlight only added emphasis to the mysterious
character of the craft.
</p>

<p>
"Let us pursue them," urged the professor.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, let's get after them," echoed Sandy.
"Puir Tom is in bad hands, I'm thinking."
</p>

<p>
"How on earth are we going to pursue them?"
gasped out Jack, whose pulses were throbbing
with indignation, "even if we could sight them
in the darkness, they are faster than we."
</p>

<p>
"That is so," agreed the professor glumly,
"and what is worse, they must have recognized us."
</p>

<p>
The professor, as we have hinted before, had
been with the boys on that memorable cruise to
tropic waters, when Dampier and Walstein very
nearly succeeded in marooning the Dacre party
and stealing their treasure recovered from a
sunken galleon.  He, as well as the boys, knew
the desperate character of the two men.
</p>

<p>
"All we can do is to keep as nearly as possible
in this spot all night," advised Jack; "then, as
soon as daylight comes, the storm may abate, and
we can take some action."
</p>

<p>
And so it was arranged.  Leaving the wheel
to Sandy, who was a muscular youth, Jack dived
below to attend to the engines, which he had
neglected for some time.  Luckily, however, the
machinery was working smoothly.  The professor
remained with Sandy on the bridge, doing
what he could to help in controlling the vessel
through the fury of the night.
</p>

<p>
Somehow the long hours of darkness passed
away, and daylight came.  The sunrise was yellow
and sickly, breaking through ragged clouds.
A chilly wind swept across the lake, but the
backbone of the storm was broken.
</p>

<p>
But, as Jack had feared deep down in his
heart, on all the expanse of leaden, rolling water,
there was no sign of another craft.  The <i>Sea
Ranger</i> was alone in the desolate scene.  A
hasty examination had shown that she had
suffered no material damage in the collision.  Some
paint was scraped off, but that was all.
</p>

<p>
Sandy got breakfast, which they ate with faint
hearts.  Jack, for his part, could hardly swallow
more than a few mouthfuls of bacon and bread
and gulp down a cup of coffee.  His mind was
actively busied with plans to rescue his brother
from the hands of men he knew to be unscrupulous,
clever and revengeful.
</p>

<p>
"It's hardly likely that they'll neglect such a
chance to get even on us for sending them to
jail and recovering the treasure," thought Jack,
with a sigh that was almost a groan.
</p>

<p>
After a hasty meal, he announced his plans.
A consultation of the chart had shown them to
be about opposite&mdash;so far as Jack could judge&mdash;a
place called Rockport.  The others heartily
agreed with his determination, which was to
head in to that place, and, by the use of the
telegraph and the assistance of the police of the
town, to get on the track of the mysterious tug
which had vanished with Tom.
</p>

<p>
While the <i>Sea Ranger</i> is cutting through the
seas toward her hastily determined destination,
let us see what had become of Tom on board the
tug that carried no lights.
</p>

<p>
"Wonder where under the sun I can be?" was
Tom's first thought, as he opened his eyes.
</p>

<p>
He had swooned from shock and immersion
immediately after he had been dragged from
the water by the crew of the tug, and had no
clear recollection of anything that followed his
being knocked overboard when the tug and the
<i>Sea Ranger</i> collided.
</p>

<p>
But it was plain enough to him, on awakening,
that he was in a place entirely strange, and of
which he had no previous recollection.
</p>

<p>
He lay in a rough bunk on a pile of none too
clean blankets.  The walls of the small room
were bare, but a round port light and the motion
of the tug told him that he was out on the water.
</p>

<p>
The boy was striving to marshal his thoughts,
when the sudden sound of voices struck on his
ears.  They seemed to come from an adjoining
cabin.  Tom listened, idly at first, but before
long he was shocked into the keenest attention.
It was evident that the conversation related to
him and his companions of the <i>Sea Ranger</i>.
With his senses vibrantly on the alert, he drank
in every word that he could catch.
</p>

<p>
No doubt, the men who were talking so freely
thought that the boy was still in a state of coma,
for they took no trouble to lower their tones.  As
Tom listened, a vague sense of having heard at
least two of the voices somewhere before stole
over him.  He could not recall where, at first,
but suddenly he caught the name "Dampier,"
and a moment later "Walstein."  The identity of
the familiar voices was thus instantly revealed
to him as by a flash of lightning.
</p>

<p>
"I tell you," were among the first words that
struck Tom's attention, "that we've run into the
biggest stroke of luck yet."
</p>

<p>
"Then you don't intend to throw the brat
overboard, as he deserves?"
</p>

<p>
In the light of what he heard later, Tom identified
this amiable proposal as coming from Walstein.
</p>

<p>
"Throw him overboard!  Why, my dear fellow,
I have nothing so crude in mind," came
Dampier's sharp, rather fastidious tones.  "If
we use him rightly, we can make a pile of money
with this lad."
</p>

<p>
"How do you propose to go about it?"
</p>

<p>
The question came from a third speaker.  For
the sake of clearness, it may be said here that
he was Captain Jeb Rangler, the skipper of the
tug, and a man whose character was of the
worst.
</p>

<p>
"Simple enough," rejoined Dampier easily.
"His uncle is rich.  He was so before they stole
the treasure of the sunken galleon away from us."
</p>

<p>
"That's pretty cool cheek," thought Tom to
himself, as he lay listening; "as if the rascals
didn't try all sorts of roguery to obtain it from
the rightful discoverers."
</p>

<p>
"Ah; I see what you mean," came in Walstein's
rumbling, hoarse tones, "you think we
can get a ransom for him?"
</p>

<p>
"You've caught the idea.  I should say that
old Chisholm Dacre would give a good bit of
money to have his nephew back safe and sound.
Especially if he knew into whose hands he had
fallen."
</p>

<p>
There was a laugh, in which all three joined,
at this.  Tom felt a shudder run through him.
</p>

<p>
"This is a nice nest of ruffians," he thought
to himself.  But the voices went on, and he
eagerly resumed his listening.
</p>

<p>
"You've got the head after all, Dampier,"
rumbled Captain Walstein's heavy bass voice.  "I
wish we could have got the others, too."
</p>

<p>
"We might have, only it was too risky to take
a chance on attacking their craft."
</p>

<p>
Tom hailed this as a bit of good news.  It
showed him that what he had half-feared,
namely, the loss of the <i>Sea Ranger</i> in the
collision, was no longer to be dreaded.
</p>

<p>
"Yes; we can't afford to take any more
chances," muttered Captain Rangler gloomily.
"That last one almost finished us.  I don't like
the idea of having the authorities so close on our
heels."
</p>

<p>
"We've got to put in for more coal, too," came
Walstein's voice.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, well, there's no danger of the tug being
identified," laughed Dampier defiantly.  "At
Alpena and at Dead Fish Point lighthouse, she was
a black and green craft named the <i>War Eagle</i>.
Now she is changed to a slate-colored tug named
the <i>Flyaway</i>.  Jove! that's a good name, too," he
chuckled.
</p>

<p>
A great light broke upon Tom.  So this was
the mysterious tug for which the authorities had
been searching?  But, from what he had heard,
the gang in control of her had disguised her
beyond recognition, and intended to keep on with
their evil trade of ship-wrecking.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'm going to head in toward the coast,"
he heard Captain Rangler say presently.  "We've
only got enough coal for a few hours."
</p>

<p>
The voices died away, as the three rose and
left the adjoining cabin.  But their conversation,
brief as it had been, had shown Tom several
things.  Not the least among these was the fact
that he was in one of the most serious predicaments
of his life.  The reflection that, not his own
fault, but a series of extraordinary coincidences
had thrown him into his perilous position, failed
to console him.
</p>

<p>
"I might just as well have been hurled into
a den of hungry tigers," thought Tom to himself,
with a rueful attempt at humor.
</p>

<p>
The door-latch rattled and the portal was flung
open at this juncture.  Without waiting to see
who his visitor might be, Tom flung himself from
his sitting posture down among the blankets.  It
did not suit his plans that the men in whose
power he was should realize that he knew at least
a part of their rascally plans concerning him.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap04"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER IV.
<br /><br />
A CRAFT OF MYSTERY.
</h3>

<p>
Tom, lying quiet amid the blankets, heard
some one cross the cabin and come to a pause so
close to him that he could hear the man's heavy
breathing.
</p>

<p>
"Wake up, there, Tom Dacre," the man said.
</p>

<p>
The lad did not move, and the command was
repeated in a louder tone.  This time Tom,
cleverly imitating the gapings and vacant expression
of one just aroused from sleep, opened his eyes.
</p>

<p>
He had no difficulty in recognizing the
features of Captain Walstein, even though a long
growth of reddish beard now flourished on the
lower part of his face.  The man's cap was
shoved back, and his leonine head of bristling,
light-colored hair showed as prominently as ever.
His features were heavier and more floridly
colored than when Tom had seen him last, but that
was the only difference, except that his costume
was a rough one,&mdash;the ordinary garb of a Great
Lake tug-boatman, in fact.
</p>

<p>
Close behind him, as he entered the cabin had
been Dampier.  He had paused at the door, to
watch events, in the furtive manner that habit
had made second nature to him.  As Tom
appeared to awaken from a sound sleep, however,
he, too, came forward.  His snake-like eyes, set
like two glittering, coal-black specks in his
sallow face, gleamed as they met Tom's frank gaze.
</p>

<p>
"Well," said Walstein, after a pause which
Tom did not break, "ain't you surprised to see us?"
</p>

<p>
"Ye-es," struck in Dampier, in his soft voice,
"it must be quite a shock to you to encounter old
friends."
</p>

<p>
"So far as friends are concerned, we'll leave
that out," spoke up Tom boldly, "and the surprise
part of it is an unwelcome one, I'm sure."
</p>

<p>
"As you'll see a good deal of us for the
succeeding few weeks, you'd better make up your
mind to keep a civil tongue in your head," snorted
Walstein.
</p>

<p>
"I keep a civil tongue, as you call it, for those
I consider my equals and superiors," said Tom;
"neither of you come in that class."
</p>

<p>
"So-o, my young fighting cock," whistled Dampier
softly, "I reckon we'll have to clip your wings
a bit.  Aren't you grateful to us for pulling you
out of the water when all your friends drowned?"
</p>

<p>
From what he had overheard of the men's
conversation, Tom knew that this latter statement
was an untrue one.  However, he did not
contradict it.
</p>

<p>
"You mean that the <i>Sea Ranger</i> is sunk!" he
exclaimed, in a voice into which he managed to
put a good deal of shocked amazement.
</p>

<p>
"That's right," said Walstein, rubbing his
hands.  "We ran into her and sank her last night,
and saved you."
</p>

<p>
"I'm surprised at that," declared Tom.  "I recollect
your saying before you were sent to prison
for your actions in the tropics, that you'd like to
wring all our necks."
</p>

<p>
"Well, it suited us to save you, anyhow,"
retorted Walstein.  "Where were you going in that
craft?"
</p>

<p>
"That can't matter much to you since she is
sunk," parried Tom.  "The question is, what are
you going to do with me?"
</p>

<p>
Dampier grinned unwholesomely.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, it's really too early to tell you that yet,"
he said, "but before you get free again, we mean
to have back a good part of that treasure you and
your uncle robbed us of."
</p>

<p>
"That you tried to rob us of, you mean," said
Tom, flushing angrily.
</p>

<p>
"Well, have it anyway you like it," said Walstein,
in his rumbly, throaty tones.  "I just want
to tell you this, though, that you are in our power,
and it will do you no good to try to get away till
we want you to."
</p>

<p>
"That will depend," rejoined Tom.
</p>

<p>
"Depend on what, pray?"
</p>

<p>
The question came from Dampier.
</p>

<p>
"On whether I see a chance to get away or
not," replied Tom.
</p>

<p>
Walstein muttered something about "taking
the impudence out of the brat," but Dampier laid
a hand on his arm.  Then he spoke with
extraordinary vehemence.
</p>

<p>
"See here, Tom Dacre," he hissed, coming quite
close, and shaking one long, yellow finger almost
in Tom's face, "I hate you.  Captain Walstein
hates you, too.  We've got good reason to, as
you know.  We're going to get even with you,
and get good and even, too."
</p>

<p>
Before Tom could reply they both left the
cabin, leaving the lad in a very unenviable frame
of mind.  His case looked hopeless, and whatever
might have been the intentions of Walstein and
Dampier when they entered, they had left again
without giving Tom any clue as to what his fate
was to be.
</p>

<p>
Before long, he grew tired of lying still, and
got out of the bunk.  He was in his shirt and
trousers, which were still damp, but his coat was
flung down on a nearby chair.  Slipping it on,
he made for the door of the cabin.
</p>

<p>
But he had hardly got it open before a gruff
voice warned him to "Get back in there, if you
know what's good for you."  A hulking big
tug-boat man stood outside the door.  He was
evidently stationed there to prevent any attempt to
escape on the part of the prisoner.  Poor Tom
felt that the blockade was quite effectual.
</p>

<p>
There followed a dreary hour, in which it began
to be borne in on the lad that he was exceedingly
hungry and thirsty as well.  He opened the
door once more.  The same sailor was on guard.
</p>

<p>
"Say, don't I get something to eat?" queried
Tom pleasantly, in response to the man's growl
to "Get back."
</p>

<p>
"Dunno, an' dun't care," grunted the sailor
sullenly.
</p>

<p>
But Tom's appeal bore fruit, for half an hour
later another sailor entered with a tray, on which
was coffee, fruit, and a big dish of ham and
eggs.
</p>

<p>
"Well, they don't intend to starve me, anyhow,"
said Tom, as his eyes fell on this unusual fare
for tugboatmen to serve.  He fell to heartily, and
ate everything before him.  So hungry had he
been that it was not till the conclusion of his
meal that he found leisure to examine the
elaborate knife and fork that had been handed him
to eat with.  He gazed at the richly chased
tableware with some interest now, however.  It bore
a name stamped on both knife and fork.
</p>

<p class="t3">
  "S. S. DETROIT CITY."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
That was what Tom read.  The words caused
his pulses to bound.  He was actually then, as
the overheard conversation had led him to expect,
on board the mysterious wreckers' tug that the
police of every big lake city were searching for.
He recalled reading of the wreck of the <i>Detroit
City</i>&mdash;a lake passenger steamer,&mdash;on a bitter
February night.  The craft had been lured to her
fate&mdash;it afterward proved&mdash;by lights that had
been tampered with.
</p>

<p>
"And these are the rascals into whose power
I have fallen," gasped Tom, his eyes fixed on the
bits of tableware which bore the name of the
ill-fated craft.
</p>

<p>
Soon after, Walstein and two sailors entered
the cabin.  Under the leonine-headed seaman's
direction, the sailors ordered Tom to thrust his
hands into a pair of rusty and antique-looking
handcuffs.  His legs, also, were pinioned.  This
done, he was borne through the door and along
the deck, to another doorway.  Then his
conductors&mdash;or rather jailers&mdash;conveyed him down a
steep flight of metal steps and through the boiler
room of the tug, into a dark, ill-smelling hole,
suffocatingly hot.
</p>

<p>
Into one corner of this place they flung him.
</p>

<p>
"I guess you can howl yourself sick in there,
and no one will hear you while we're at the
dock," chuckled Walstein brutally, as he went out,
slamming the bulkhead door behind him.
</p>

<p>
Soon after the vibratory motion of the engines
ceased, and Tom could hear shouts and tramplings
on deck.  He guessed they were making
fast to some dock, but where their stopping place
was, he had, of course, no means of knowing.
</p>

<p>
In spite of Walstein's words, Tom did shout.
He yelled and cried out for help till his throat
was sore and cracked, and his voice a mere
whisper.  But no help came to the dark, stuffy place
in which he had been flung.

<h3>
CHAPTER V.
<br /><br />
TOM IS IN THE THICK OF IT.
</h3>

<p>
Tom had no way of gauging how long it was
he lay in the pitchy darkness, before there was a
scraping and a sliding sound, and a sort of
trap-door in the deck above him was opened.
</p>

<p>
He was still wondering what this might portend,
when the lip of a metal chute was suddenly
projected into the opening, and without warning
a shower of coal started to pour into the place,
which, Tom now saw, was an empty coal bunker.
</p>

<p>
The boy shouted and halloed at the top of his
voice, but it was some time before anybody
appeared.  By the time they did, the avalanche of
coal threatened to overwhelm poor Tom, and his
position was anything but enviable.
</p>

<p>
At length, however, a face was poked over the
edge of the hole, and Tom, to his great relief,
heard a voice shout:
</p>

<p>
"Stop that coal a minute.  There's a boy down
in here."
</p>

<p>
The man, or rather youth, who had shouted
this, swung himself down into the bunker the
next instant, and despite the grime on his face,
Tom recognized an old acquaintance.
</p>

<p>
"Jeff Trulliber!" he gasped.
</p>

<p>
The son of the chief of the Sawmill Valley
gang of counterfeiters was equally astonished.
</p>

<p>
"Why, it's Master Dacre!" he exclaimed, starting
back in astonishment.
</p>

<p>
"That's who it is," rejoined Tom, with a rueful
grin.  "I want you to help me, Jeff.  But first
tell me if any of the crew of this craft are about."
</p>

<p>
"Not one of them.  The skipper and two other
chaps, who seemed to be his cronies, went ashore
some time ago, and, as soon as they were gone,
the crew left, too.  I guess they are all
carousing.  But what under the sun&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Never mind questions now, Jeff.  I want you
to set me loose.  See if there is a cold chisel
and hammer in the engine room, and you can
soon get this unornamental jewelry off me."
</p>

<p>
"I'll do that," responded Jeff eagerly.
</p>

<p>
Tom indicated the door leading from the
bunker into the engine room, and Jeff, after
rummaging about in there a while, located the
required implements.  In a very few minutes, for
the irons that confined his limbs were old and
rusty, Tom was free.
</p>

<p>
While they were hastening from the boat, Tom
told Jeff rapidly as much as he chose of his
story, and then it was his turn to ask questions.
</p>

<p>
It will be recalled that the last time we saw
Jeff was when the canoe, in which he was trying
to escape with Dan Dark, was upset in the
lake opposite the Maine bungalow.  Tom's heroic
rescue of the lad, just as he was about to be
sucked into the old lumber flume, will also be
recalled by readers of <i>The Bungalow Boys</i>, the
first volume of this series.
</p>

<p>
His rescue from a tragic death had proved
the turning point in Jeff Trulliber's life.  He had
recalled the fact that he had an uncle in Michigan
who had long disowned himself and his disreputable
father.  Jeff had sought and found this relative
and obtained his forgiveness, and had been
placed at work in the coal yard which was one
of his uncle's properties.  From workman he had
rapidly risen to foreman, such was his application
and ability.  He was genuinely glad to be
able to do a service for the lad who had risked
so much for him.
</p>

<p>
"What place is this?" inquired Tom, as Jeff
concluded his story, amidst Tom's congratulations.
</p>

<p>
"Rockport, Michigan.  It is quite a town."
</p>

<p>
"Is there a police force here?" inquired Tom.
</p>

<p>
"A finely organized one.  I see what is in your
mind.  You want to report the character of this
craft and her crew to the authorities.  I don't
blame you.  Tell you what we do&mdash;I'll go uptown
with you.  We can get there and back before
the rascals that own the tug can return.  I'll tell
my men to delay in coaling her, so that even if
that outfit does come back, they cannot get away."
</p>

<p>
"That's a good idea, Jeff.  Let's go at once."
</p>

<p>
Rockport, in Jeff's phrase, proved to be "quite
a town."  The wharves, at one of which the tug
lay, were numerous, and lumber yards and
factories extended all along the water front.  Quite
a lot of lake steamers and smaller craft lay at
them, giving the place a busy, bustling appearance.
</p>

<p>
But, not stopping to waste time on surveying
the lake front of the town, Tom and his new ally
set out at a good pace for the police station.
</p>

<p>
In the meantime, Captain Rangler, Dampier
and Walstein were making their way back to
the tug from the main part of the city where
they had been negotiating some purchases of
supplies.
</p>

<p>
As they emerged from a cross street near the
water front, their conversation was concerning
Tom.  Captain Rangler was just remarking, with
a grin, that as soon as the letter to Chisholm
Dacre was written, they could make for a certain
rendezvous of theirs on an island, and wait "for
the coin," when Walstein suddenly gave an
exclamation, and pulled his companions into a
convenient doorway.
</p>

<p>
"What the dickens&mdash;" began Dampier, startled
at this move.  But Captain Walstein checked him.
</p>

<p>
"Hist!" he exclaimed.  "Look down there, at
the bottom of this street.  By all that's cussed,
there goes the boy now."
</p>

<p>
"Impossible," burst forth Dampier, but Walstein
threw in a swift interjection.
</p>

<p>
"By the great horn spoon, it is Tom Dacre!"
he exclaimed.  "How in the name of time did he
escape?"
</p>

<p>
"We'll find that out later," snarled Dampier
vindictively.  "The thing to do now is to follow
him and see what he and that chap with him are
up to.  Rangler, you go back to the tug.  Walstein
and I will follow him up.  It wouldn't astonish
me if he's off to put the police on our track."
</p>

<p>
"Nor me, either," agreed Walstein, as, after
a few words more, Rangler hastened to the lake
front, while Dampier and his companion stealthily
crept off in pursuit of Tom and Jeff, who
were, of course, utterly unconscious of being
followed.
</p>

<p>
Reaching the police station, the two lads found,
to their chagrin, only a sleepy sergeant in charge.
The captain had been out all night on a case, they
were informed, and, with his detectives, was now
at a court-house some miles off, with his prisoners.
</p>

<p>
Tom and Jeff exchanged disgusted looks, as the
official yawned and returned to reading the
newspaper, in the perusal of which their entrance had
interrupted him.
</p>

<p>
"Can't you do anything for us?" asked Tom
eagerly, unwilling to give up all at once.  "It may
be the last chance the authorities will have to
catch those rascals."
</p>

<p>
The sergeant looked up from his paper.
</p>

<p>
"See here, young fellow," he said in a belligerent
tone, "are you setting to teach me my business?"
</p>

<p>
Tom hastily assured him that such was not the
case.
</p>

<p>
"But it is urgent that if anything is to be
done it should be done at once," pursued the boy.
"Those fellows on that tug&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Now, stop right there," warned the officer of
the law, who had such a high idea of his
importance, "what is right to be done will be done.
What ain't, won't.  Anyhow," he demanded,
turning suddenly on the two lads, "how do I know
you're speaking the truth, eh?
</p>

<p>
"Come to think of it," he added, suddenly
rising from his seat and coming out from behind the
desk, "you two fellows remind me a good deal
of the description of two runaway bank messengers
we've been asked to look for.  They were
supposed to be making for Canada.  Yes," he
said sharply, "I guess you're the lads, all right;
anyway, I'll lock you up till you can prove
otherwise.  Dan!" he raised his voice, "Mike, Pete!"
</p>

<p>
At the words, three men appeared from a rear
room.  Tom saw in a flash that if this arrest was
submitted to, it might result in the rascals who
had abducted him getting clear away.  He determined,
in a flash, not to allow this if he could
help it.  As the first of the men ran at him, he
thrust out a foot, and the fellow came down with
a crash.  Before any of the rest could recover
from their surprise, the lad was off like a dart.
</p>

<p>
Behind him came shouts, but Tom was fleet
of foot, and dodged and turned, like a rabbit
with a pack of dogs hot on its tracks.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly, as he turned a corner, a voice
sounded right at his shoulder: "In here, quick!"
</p>

<p>
Without thinking what he was doing, Tom
darted into the doorway whence the voice had
come.  Hardly had he entered it, before he was
seized, and received a brutal blow on the side of
the head, hard enough to stun him.
</p>

<p>
"What a bit of luck!" exclaimed one of the men
who had lured the lad into the doorway.
</p>

<p>
"It sure is that," was the rejoinder from his
companion, who, if the reader has not already
guessed it, was none other than Walstein, with
his partner, Dampier.  Tom, unfamiliar with
Rockport, had actually doubled on his own tracks,
and thus, the two men on their way up a narrow
alley, had spied him just dashing into it.  In a
flash their minds were made up, and they slid
hastily into the doorway in which they had
trapped poor Tom.
</p>

<p>
They had tracked the two lads to the station,
but as they neared it, the nerve of the two rascals
had failed them.
</p>

<p>
"We don't want to run our heads into a halter,"
Dampier had said.  "We'll have to let the lad go
for the present."
</p>

<p>
Walstein was quite willing to agree with him
in this, having no better liking for the vicinity of
the law than his companion.
</p>

<p>
Naturally, they were considerably mystified as
to the cause of Tom's sudden appearance; but
Dampier, who had a shrewd mind, partially
unraveled the solution, when he said:
</p>

<p>
"I reckon the police were not quite as willing
to listen to his story as he thought they'd be.
Maybe he got mad and gave 'em impudence!"
</p>

<p>
"In that case they'll be right after him," said
Walstein.  "We'd better be getting out of here
on the jump."
</p>

<p>
"I think so, too.  Here, help me with the boy.
See, this alley-way runs right through to another
street.  We'll hurry down it and then get back to
the tug as fast as we can.  Come on.  There's no
time to lose."
</p>

<p>
The alley-way, on which the door opened
through which Tom had dashed, proved to lead
into a quiet, retired thoroughfare, at the foot of
which the masts of shipping could be seen.
</p>

<p>
The two men, half-dragging, half-supporting
poor Tom, hastened down it.
</p>

<p>
As they neared the water front, however, a
strange thing occurred.  Their grasp on the
supposedly semi-conscious Tom had been light.  They
had not deemed it necessary to be over-vigilant.
Now they realized their mistake, for Tom, with a
swift movement, dived out of their grip, and the
next instant was darting off&mdash;free once more.
The blow had been a hard one, but it had not
made him half so stupefied as the lad's cleverness
had led his captors to believe.

<h3>
CHAPTER VI.
<br /><br />
ALONG A TRAIL OF TROUBLES.
</h3>

<p>
Like the other Tom of the immortal rhyme, our
lad went "dashing down the street" as though on
the wings of the wind.  Behind him came shouts
and yells, but he paid no attention to them.  He
did not know that, at the very moment that he
had succeeded in eluding the grip of Walstein
and Dampier, the pursuing police had, in turn,
picked up the trail of those two worthies.  Seeing
Tom in the grip of the rascals, the skeptical
sergeant, who was one of the party, immediately
began to put more stock in Tom's story than he had
hitherto.
</p>

<p>
"The lad was telling the truth after all, I
believe," he said.
</p>

<p>
"Of course he was," said Jeff indignantly, for
the boy, who had established his identity and
vouched for Tom, had come along, too.
</p>

<p>
The approach to Walstein and Dampier was
made with all due caution, but just as the officers
of the law were about to dart forward upon the
two rascals, Tom made his surprising escape.  At
the same instant Walstein and Dampier, likewise,
dashed off after Tom, so that there was a sort of
triple pursuit on&mdash;Tom in chase of liberty,
Walstein and Dampier in hot pursuit of Tom, and the
police and Jeff in quest of both Tom and his
recent captors.
</p>

<p>
Hearing the shouts of the police behind them,
Dampier and Walstein turned to see what this
new development might portend.  It didn't take
them the wink of an eyelid to comprehend what
was occurring.
</p>

<p>
"Stop, or I'll shoot!" cried the leader of the
authorities.
</p>

<p>
Tom heard the shout, and, not having spared
time to look behind him, attributed the cry,
naturally enough, to Walstein or Dampier.  Naturally,
also, it caused him to dash on faster than ever.
</p>

<p>
Bang!
</p>

<p>
The noise of a shot came behind him.  The
policeman's bullet grazed Dampier's ear, but it
didn't stop him.
</p>

<p>
Right ahead was a lumber yard.  Big stacks of
timber were piled all about.  Tom felt that if he
could once gain it, he could find comparative
safety from pursuit among its intricacies.
</p>

<p>
Dampier and Walstein, behind him, had the
same feeling.  Moreover, they knew the water
front of Rockport well, and realized that it was
a step from the lumber yard to where their swift
tug lay, freshly coaled, and, if their orders had
been followed, with steam up.
</p>

<p>
Tom gained the lumber yard, and darted like
an arrow in among the piles of resinous smelling
timber.  In and out, he dodged, while the cries
behind him grew fainter.
</p>

<p>
"Thank goodness, I seem to have them thrown
off my track," he exclaimed, as he stopped to
breathe.
</p>

<p>
After he had recovered a bit, he began to walk
forward through the lumber yard.  A few turns
brought him to a wharf.  As he saw the craft
that lay moored there, Tom gave a gasp of
astonishment, and then a cry of joy.
</p>

<p>
It was the dear old <i>Sea Ranger</i>!
</p>

<p>
There she lay, as trim and tight as if the
exciting events that had followed the storm had
never occurred.
</p>

<p>
But, as the lad was stepping forward with
joyous anticipation of being reunited to his
chums, he was brought to a sudden halt by a
queer sound behind him.
</p>

<p>
Tom stood stock-still and listened intently.
</p>

<p>
The noise came again.  It seemed to proceed
from behind one of the nearby stacks of lumber.
</p>

<p>
"Funny sound," mused Tom; "wonder what it
is?  It&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oo-oo-oo-h!"
</p>

<p>
"It's a man's groan," the lad exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, don't strike me again!  Please don't,"
came the gurgling moan once more.
</p>

<p>
"That fellow's badly hurt," decided Tom.
</p>

<p>
"Guess I'd better see what's the trouble," he
resolved the next instant.
</p>

<p>
Stepping round one of the lumber piles, he came
upon the injured man.  He lay in a huddle on
the planked floor of the wharf.  One arm was
upraised, as if to ward off a blow, as he heard
Tom's footsteps.
</p>

<p>
"Don't hit me again!  Don't!" he begged.
</p>

<p>
"I'm not going to hurt you.  I'm&mdash;&mdash;  Gracious
heavens!" he half-shouted the next instant.
"It's&mdash;it's Professor Podsnap!"
</p>

<p>
There was a red stain on the professor's face,
as if he had been struck by some blunt weapon.
His face was white and pitiful, as he looked up at
Tom.  He recognized him with a groan of dismay.
</p>

<p>
"You&mdash;you've come too late, my boy," he
exclaimed weakly, and fell back.
</p>

<p>
It was some seconds before Tom, kneeling
beside him, was able to catch any more.  Then the
professor spoke again.  But his voice was so
feeble that Tom had to bend down to catch the
words.
</p>

<p>
"Jack&mdash;" gasped the man of science, "Jack
and Sandy&mdash;they&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," spoke Tom eagerly, "yes, where are they?"
</p>

<p>
"Gone!"
</p>

<p>
"Gone?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, abducted.  We entered this port a short
time ago.  We were setting out for the town to
communicate with the authorities concerning your
loss, when all of a sudden we ran into a gang of
men."
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;yes," said Tom eagerly.
</p>

<p>
"Well, we didn't pay any attention to them, for
they were a rough-looking crowd, but suddenly
one of them exclaimed: 'There's two of those
boys, now!'  With that they all rushed at us,
and&mdash;and something struck me, and that's all I
can recall."
</p>

<p>
A fear that made him feel sick and faint
clutched at Tom's heart.
</p>

<p>
"These men, what did they look like?" he asked,
dreading to hear the answer.
</p>

<p>
"Like sea-faring men.  I should have said they
were on their way to some ship.  Stay!  I heard
a name mentioned.  It&mdash;it was&mdash;let me
see&mdash;Spangler, I think."
</p>

<p>
"Rangler," struck in Tom, with vibrating heart.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, that was it&mdash;Rangler."
</p>

<p>
"Good gracious!  He is the captain of that
tug that Walstein and Dampier were on board of."
</p>

<p>
"In that case, don't wait here to bother about
me.  Let us get help at once."
</p>

<p>
The professor staggered weakly to his feet,
while Tom supported him as best he was able.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, those ruffians will pay dearly for this, if
ever I can make them," breathed Tom.  "Poor
Jack and Sandy, they're in their power now."
</p>

<p>
Suddenly came voices, several of them.  It was
the party of police, accompanied by Jeff, and
enlarged by several dock loungers and workmen.
</p>

<p>
"Here's Tom Dacre, now," exclaimed Jeff
joyfully, hastening forward as he spied the lad.
"Thank goodness, those scoundrels didn't get you.
But&mdash;but what's happened?" he asked, gazing
from the professor to Tom and from Tom to the
professor.
</p>

<p>
Tom explained quickly.  Then he said: "Somebody
get a doctor, quick, for Professor Podsnap."
</p>

<p>
"There's one has an office right close,"
volunteered one of the crowd, "accidents often happen
on the docks."
</p>

<p>
"Officer Dugan, be off and get him," ordered
the sergeant of police, who looked very
crestfallen.  "Young man," he said to Tom, "I owe
you an apology for doubting your story."
</p>

<p>
"You owe me more than that," said Tom, with
a bitterness he could not help.  "Here, Jeff, help
me get the professor on board the <i>Sea Ranger</i>.
Be as quick as you can, we must set off in
pursuit of Walstein and Dampier."
</p>

<p>
At these words the police exchanged glances
and looked foolish, while Jeff burst out angrily:
</p>

<p>
"They've slipped through our fingers, Master Tom."
</p>

<p>
"How&mdash;how is that?" bewilderedly asked Tom.
"Isn't their tug still there?"
</p>

<p>
"It slipped out of the port while we were
searching for those two rascals," said one of the
policemen.
</p>

<p>
Tom looked thunderstruck.  He could not speak.
The stupidity of the police of Rockport seemed
more than incredible.
</p>

<p>
"Then they're gone?" he asked dully.  There
was a ringing pain in his head.  His heart felt
like a lump of lead.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Master Tom," said Jeff wonderfully
gently, and slipping to Tom's side, "thanks to
those chumps of police they have gotten away
without waiting for all the coal to be put in.  But
we can telegraph every place and soon have them
stopped and their craft searched for your brother
and your chum.  I&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Why don't the police get after them?" demanded
Tom, anger replacing stupefaction, "why
isn't there another tug after them, a&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"They got too long a start, and there isn't a
craft in this harbor that is fast enough to be of
any use in chasing them," put in one of the men
who had aided in the time-wasting search among
the lumber.
</p>

<p>
Tom flushed angrily.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, there is&mdash;one!" he exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
"Where?"  The question came from the dull-witted
sergeant.
</p>

<p>
"Right there," said Tom, waving his hand
toward the <i>Sea Ranger</i>; "do you think I'm going
to let those rascals steal my brother and my chum
without doing something?"
</p>

<p>
"By ginger, Tom, when can you start?"
</p>

<p>
It was Jeff who spoke, warmly, admiringly.
His eyes shone with the contagion of Tom's
enthusiasm.
</p>

<p>
"Just as soon as a doctor has attended to the
professor.  Hello, here he comes now.  How do
you feel now, professor?"
</p>

<p>
"Like taking after that cargo of villains as
soon as we can get away," was the warlike and
unexpected reply of the usually mild-mannered
professor.
</p>

<p>
"But your injury?" asked Tom, self-reproachful
at having in his indignation almost forgotten
the professor's condition.
</p>

<p>
"I feel almost sound again&mdash;I really do,"
stoutly declared the professor.
</p>

<p>
The doctor, who had been so hastily summoned,
coming up at this instant, the party adjourned to
the stateroom of the <i>Sea Ranger</i>.  The medico
pronounced that the wound that had laid the
professor low, while it had been painful, was not
dangerous.  He also prescribed some lotion for a
large, knobby protuberance that was making itself
manifest on Tom's cranium, where Dampier had
struck him.
</p>

<p>
In the midst of this conference, the door was
hastily thrown open, and Jeff entered.  He
carried a big carpet-bag, and behind him stood a
bulging-eyed negro.
</p>

<p>
"Hello, Jeff," exclaimed Tom warmly, looking
up.  "Come to say good-by?"
</p>

<p>
"No, I'm going with you," was the decisive
answer.
</p>

<p>
"An' ah hev bin hired as general factotum,"
announced the negro, with a grin.
</p>

<p>
"Why, Jeff, what does all this mean?" asked
Tom.  "I was going to engage some trustworthy
men to go along."
</p>

<p>
"You don't need any," said Jeff shortly.  "You
did me a good turn once, Tom Dacre, that I'll
never forget.  You saved me from death, and
likewise from a criminal life."
</p>

<p>
"But your work here, Jeff; you can't leave that
to go on this cruise.  Really, I&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"It's all been arranged," calmly announced Jeff.
"My uncle agrees that it's my duty to stand by
you in your trouble.  So another man is already
on my job.  And now that's all accounted for, let's
get under way at once," he went on calmly.
</p>

<p>
Tom looked interrogatively at the negro, who
stood modestly in the doorway, grinning widely
and twisting and untwisting a pair of agile legs.
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" exclaimed Jeff with a laugh, seeing
Tom's look, and interpreting it correctly as a
question as to the negro's identity, "that's
Rosewater.  He&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Yas, sah!  Yas, sah!  Yas, sah!" said Rosewater,
bowing three times with wonderful swiftness.
</p>

<p>
"He's been a sort of handy man to me round
the dock, and when he heard I was going on this
cruise, he insisted on coming, too.  We'll find him
useful.  He can&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
"Kin cook! kin wash! kin sing! kin dance! an'&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Can't keep quiet," said Jeff in a jocular
undertone to Tom, "he's a West Indian, and faithful
as a spaniel dog."
</p>

<p>
And in this way, Rosewater&mdash;they never heard
of any other name for him, even the negro did
not know of one himself&mdash;became a member of
the <i>Sea Ranger's</i> crew on one of the most
adventurous cruises any of the party had ever
embarked upon.
</p>

<p>
Half an hour after the doctor had patched up
the professor, and had left the craft, the engines,
under Tom's management, began to revolve.
</p>

<p>
With Jeff&mdash;a skilful steersman&mdash;at the wheel,
the professor "standing by," and Rosewater in
the galley, they glided out of the harbor of
Rockport, heading at top speed for a distant smudge
of smoke on the Huron horizon.
</p>

<p>
That smudge of smoke marked the tug of the
desperadoes of whom they were in pursuit, but it
seemed terribly faint and far off and almost as
impossible of attainment as the pot of gold at the
rainbow's foot.

<h3>
CHAPTER VII.
<br /><br />
TWO BRAVE LADS AT BAY.
</h3>

<p>
"Are you there, Sandy?"
</p>

<p>
Through the darkness in the hold of the tug,
in which they were confined (and which had
recently been the place of Tom's captivity), Jack's
voice reached the Scotch lad.
</p>

<p>
"I dinna ken.  But I think so," he responded
cautiously.  "Some of me's here, anyhow.  Whist,
Jack, we're in a tight place."
</p>

<p>
"And a dark one, too," said Jack gloomily.
</p>

<p>
"What d'ye think they'll do wi' us?"
</p>

<p>
"I have no notion.  But what they have done
already gives a sufficient idea of what they are
capable of.  There may be bigger rascals on
earth than this outfit, but I don't know where
you'd look for them."
</p>

<p>
"By the peak of Ben Nevis, that was a dire
crack on the head that Captain Mangler gave me
when they attacked us in that lumber yard."
</p>

<p>
"His name's Rangler&mdash;though 'Mangler' would
about fit him," rejoined Jack.  "They didn't strike
me, but just picked me up and stifled my cries&mdash;just
as I was going to the rescue of the poor
professor, too, I fear they may have killed him."
</p>

<p>
"I dinna think so.  But I hope he is not on
board this tug."
</p>

<p>
"Why?"
</p>

<p>
"Because, if he is, there'll be no one left
behind to give a clue as to our whereabouts."
</p>

<p>
"Even if they could, I don't see what good it
would do," was the gloomy rejoinder.  "Poor
Tom's still missing, and&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Whist, lad!  Dinna be downcast.  Tom will
turn oop&mdash;like a bad penny&mdash;not that he is one,
but in a manner of speaking.  I'm sure he's all
right.  He will look out for himself and rescue us,
too, I'll bet ye a siller bit."
</p>

<p>
"I hope you are right, Sandy, but this is surely
a disastrous ending to what promised to be a
pleasure trip."
</p>

<p>
"There's a linin' of bonnie gold to every cloud,"
comforted the philosophical Sandy.  "But," he
added with Scotch candor, "I'm blessed if I can
see aught but the cloud the noo'."
</p>

<p>
There was silence for a time.
</p>

<p>
"Let's explore this place a bit," suggested Jack
presently.
</p>

<p>
"Too dark," responded Sandy, "we might fall
into some trap-door or hole."
</p>

<p>
"We can feel our way with our hands&mdash;oh!"
and Jack almost laughed at his mistake&mdash;"mine
are handcuffed."
</p>

<p>
"Mine, too, but I hadna' forgotten the fact,"
said Sandy dryly.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose, then, we must wait here till
somebody comes."
</p>

<p>
"I guess that's aboot it.  It's no' vera cheerful,
but it can't be helped, as the man said when they
were gangin' to hang him."
</p>

<p>
The vibration of the propeller of the tug could
be plainly felt.  The whole craft shook with it.
It was clear that all the speed possible was being
crowded on.
</p>

<p>
The heat, too, grew almost stifling.  The hold
was back of the boiler room, in which forced
draught was being kept up, while the steam-gauges
showed a pressure almost up to bursting
point.  Walstein and Dampier, after safely
gaining the tug, following the chase through the
lumber yard, had decided to lose no time in putting
all the distance possible between themselves and
Rockport.  Their joyful reception of the news
that, although they had lost Tom Dacre, his place
had been taken by his brother Jack, may be
imagined.  Sandy they did not care so much about.
They did not know that his father was quite as
rich&mdash;or richer&mdash;than Chisholm Dacre.  But both
had been warm in their congratulations to
Captain Rangler on what they deemed his clever
capture.
</p>

<p>
"Phew-w-w-w!  This place is like a furnace,"
observed Jack, after another silence of some
duration.  "How about you, Sandy?"
</p>

<p>
"It's hot, all right.  I'd give a whole lot for a
drink of water.  I feel as dry as a stale loaf of
bread."
</p>

<p>
"Talking of bread, I wonder if they mean to
starve us or let us die of thirst?"
</p>

<p>
"Impossible to tell.  I dinna ken what they
mean to do.  I suppose they are capable of
anything."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, the inhuman ruffians!  But what is
worrying me is, that, supposing they don't mean to
starve us, or let us die of thirst, what <i>do</i> they
mean to do with us?"
</p>

<p>
The question was a puzzling one.
</p>

<p>
"If they don't kill us, they'll have to keep us
with them all the time," said Sandy gloomily,
after a while.
</p>

<p>
"Maybe they'll maroon us, like they did down
in the tropics.  There are plenty of islands in
this part of Lake Huron."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, but this isn't an untraveled region, like
it was down there.  In course of time we should
be picked up."
</p>

<p>
"Hum!  Yes, that's so.  Tell you what, Sandy,
if we get a chance to escape, we'll make for some
island and hide there till an opportunity comes
to get off."
</p>

<p>
"Jack, do you recall that island where the
ghost was snoopin' around?  Ye ken the one I
mean?"
</p>

<p>
"Do I?  I should say so.  Well, that was as
tight a scrape as this, but we got out of it, all
right."
</p>

<p>
"So we did," agreed Sandy, cheering up, and
with almost a lively ring in his tones, "and that
fix was our own fault, too.  If we hadn't tried
tricks on the professor and got tied to that turtle,
we wouldn't have been marooned."
</p>

<p>
"Well, in this case we haven't even the
satisfaction of blaming ourselves," whimsically
remarked Jack.
</p>

<p>
The hours wore slowly away.  At first the
long wait in the darkness was merely tedious.
Then it began to grow painful, and at length,
such were the boys' thirst and hunger and
suffering from the intense heat, that they went
almost crazy.
</p>

<p>
Work as they would at their bonds, they could
not loosen them.  The steel bracelets resisted all
efforts to unfasten them.  To make matters
worse, when the lads flung themselves wearily
down to try and pass the interminable hours in
the forgetfulness of sleep, they found that they
were not the sole tenants of the hold.
</p>

<p>
Huge rats presently began scampering about.
The creatures at first rushed off when the boys
cried "Scat!"  But, after a time, they grew
bolder, and came in legions.  The lads could hear
their squeakings and bickerings as they nosed
about them.  It was truly a horrible sensation.
Little red eyes, like needlepoints of fire, burned
through the darkness, and Jack recalled tales he
had read of prisoners whose bones had been
picked of flesh by the loathsome rodents.
</p>

<p>
"They'd find us tough picking," laughed
Sandy, when Jack communicated his fears, but
in his easy manner the Scotch lad concealed a
world of real, almost desperate, anxiety.
</p>

<p>
Their position was plainly growing more and
more untenable.  Already their heads felt as if
they would burst from the intense heat and
stuffiness of the hold.  Then, too, their long fast
had made them weak.  Queer buzzings sounded
in their ears.  Shapes, that they knew were
unreal, flitted through the darkness, like forms
compounded of greenish, luminous smoke.
</p>

<p>
And still the tug raced along.  The roar of
her laboring engines filled the little craft,
making her quiver from stem to stern.
</p>

<p>
"Wonder where on earth she can be?" thought
Jack, in a dull sort of semi-stupid voice.
</p>

<p>
"I dinna ken, an' before long it willna' matter
to us, anyhow," was Sandy's miserable response.
All his fund of hopefulness had vanished.
</p>

<p>
As if in mockery at his words, the rats
squeaked louder than ever as he uttered them.
Their little bright eyes darted here and there
in the darkness before the boys' swimming vision,
like thousands of crazy fireflies.  Clearly, if help
did not come soon, there would be two less among
the company the tug was carrying across Lake
Huron, at racing speed.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap08"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII.
<br /><br />
A TOUR OF EXPLORATION.
</h3>

<p>
"Hullo, the motion of the tug seems to have
stopped."
</p>

<p>
The thought filtered dully through Sandy's
benumbed mind.  For some minutes, indeed, the
speed had been sensibly slackening, but in the
lads' deplorable circumstances, they were neither
of them in a condition to be speedily aware of
the fact.
</p>

<p>
"Jack!  Jack!" hailed Sandy, eager to announce
his news.  But no answer came out of the
darkness.  Poor Jack lay unconscious on the floor
of the hold.  He had given way under the strain
and stifling heat.
</p>

<p>
Sandy guessed as much, when he got no reply.
The realization of Jack's condition acted as a
tonic to him.  Summoning up every one of his
dormant faculties, the lad resolved on a last
effort.
</p>

<p>
Reckless of the consequences, if there were
any trap-doors or holes in the floors of the hold,
he plunged forward into the velvety darkness.
He could hear the patter-patter of myriads of
tiny rat feet as he did so, but the Scotch lad was
long past caring for that.  The fighting instinct
of a race of fighting ancestors was fully aroused
in him.  He felt that it would have taken half
a dozen men to stop him.
</p>

<p>
Bump!  Without warning, Sandy had suddenly
blundered up against what seemed to be a solid
wall.
</p>

<p>
"Well, here's something, at any rate," he
mused to himself.  "Now, if I can only find a
door in it, I'll fling myself against it and make
such a racket that they'll be bound to come down,
unless they are made of steel and iron instead
of flesh and blood."
</p>

<p>
Then began what seemed an eternity of groping.
Raising his handcuffed wrists, Sandy felt
for a chink in the smooth bulkhead.  Quite as
suddenly as he had collided with the wall, his
fingers encountered a crack.
</p>

<p>
"Eureka!" exclaimed the boy.  "I guess this is
what I want."
</p>

<p>
As well as he could judge, after a brief examination,
the crack extended clear to the floor of
the hold.
</p>

<p>
"It must be a door," thought Sandy.  And then:
</p>

<p>
"Now for it," he murmured.
</p>

<p>
With a blood-curdling yell, he flung his form
against the bulkhead.
</p>

<p>
The next instant he was lying flat on his face.
</p>

<p>
The door against which he had flung himself
had opened smoothly and noiselessly, and the
strenuous force of Sandy's shove had carried
him, with a crash, into what seemed to be a
cabin.
</p>

<p>
For a few seconds he was past caring what
the place was.  He just lay there in the light,
pumping his lungs full of blessed fresh air.
</p>

<p>
"Phew!  If my lungs aren't saying 'thank you,
kind master,' this very instant, they're an
ungrateful pair of organs," said the whimsical
Scotch lad, half aloud.
</p>

<p>
The cabin was empty and sparsely furnished.
But on deck could be heard the trampling of feet.
Sunshine streamed through the skylight above,
and Sandy judged it must be very early morning.
They had lain in the stifling heat of that
black hole for an afternoon and a night then.
</p>

<p>
After a few minutes, Sandy struggled to his
feet and looked about him.  The fresh air had
hugely strengthened and revived him.  He felt
a new courage coursing through his veins.
</p>

<p>
In the center of the cabin was a swinging
table, bearing the remains of a rough meal.  But
never had food looked so good to the boy as did
those remnants of corned beef and cabbage, and
some sort of soggy pudding, and&mdash;a most welcome
sight of all&mdash;a big glass pitcher full of
sparkling, clear water.
</p>

<p>
Sandy determined to free Jack somehow, and
then, together, they would enjoy a long drink
and something of a meal, come what might.  But
how to accomplish this?  That was the problem.
</p>

<p>
All at once, from the hold behind him, came
a cry.
</p>

<p>
"It's Jack!  The fresh air must have revived
him.  Thank goodness for that," breathed Sandy
fervently.  Then uttering a loud "Hush," he
made his way back into the hold.
</p>

<p>
Even in the short time the door had been open,
the air had noticeably freshened.  The place was
filled with a dull, half light too.  The semi-twilight
revealed a big pile of boxes and bales in
one corner of the place, but Sandy had no eyes
for that.  All he could see just then was the
gaunt, hollow-eyed figure of Jack Dacre,
staggering toward him.
</p>

<p>
"Courage, old chap," he exclaimed.  "We've
gained one step already."
</p>

<p>
"How on earth did that door get open?" gasped
Jack, breathing the fresher air in great gulping
sobs.
</p>

<p>
"Aweell now," grinned Sandy, "I guess that,
unbeknownst to mysel', I must have whispered
'Open Sesame,' for the thing just swung open
when I bumped against it."
</p>

<p>
The two lads were soon in the cabin, their
minds busily at work as to how to free their
hands.  Suddenly Jack spied a bunch of keys
hanging on the wall.
</p>

<p>
"Maybe some of those would fit," he suggested
hopefully.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps.  We can try, anyhow.  But how
can we get them?"
</p>

<p>
"Easy enough.  Like this."
</p>

<p>
Jack stood on tiptoe and seized the bunch in
his teeth like a terrier seizing a rat.  He dropped
them on the table.  Then came the problem of
selecting one that would fit.
</p>

<p>
"This looks as if it might do," said Jack,
literally "nosing" at a small, rusty key among the
bunch.
</p>

<p>
"We can try it, anyhow," said Sandy; "take it
in your teeth, and see if it does belong to these
bits of iron jewelry."
</p>

<p>
It was a difficult and tedious task, but Jack at
last accomplished it, and had the key inserted
in the lock of Sandy's handcuffs.  It fitted
perfectly.  Sandy laid his hands out flat on the
table, so as to hold the handcuffs rigid, and then
Jack gave a twist.
</p>

<p>
There was a sharp click, and Sandy was free.
</p>

<p>
"Now for you," he exclaimed, and, taking the
key from Jack, with his now-free hands, he soon
had that lad disburdened of his incumbrances.
The lads really had some difficulty in keeping
from cheering when this was accomplished.  But,
of course, they didn't.  In fact, although they
were now a little better off than they had been
before, they were by no means "out of the
woods" as yet.  Like the young bears in the
fable, they had still most of their troubles
before them.  But, nevertheless, it was a great
relief to have air and the freedom of their hands.
</p>

<p>
"I guess the tug must have anchored,"
observed Sandy.  "Wonder if we are lying at any
city?  If so, we could make a dash for it, and
chance to there being somebody around who
would help us out of our difficulties."
</p>

<p>
"I wish we had some sort of weapons," said
Jack.  "At any rate, we could make a fight for
it.  I feel as if I'd do anything rather than go
back to that hold again."
</p>

<p>
"So do I.  But let's get that water and then
tackle some grub.  I never felt so hungry in my
life."
</p>

<p>
No more time was wasted on mere words.
The boys fell to on the table scraps, as if they
were starved&mdash;as indeed they were.
</p>

<p>
And how good that water tasted!  Never had
the most delicious soda either of them had ever
sampled one-quarter of the cool delight of that
pitcher full of "aqua pura."
</p>

<p>
"Ah-h-h-h!" breathed Jack, with a sigh of
repletion, "that was something like."
</p>

<p>
"It was all of that," agreed Sandy, "and then
some.  But speaking of weapons, what do you
know about those?"
</p>

<p>
He indicated a brace of pistols, which had
been hitherto unnoticed by the lads.  The
weapons lay on a locker, and appeared to have been
hastily deposited there by some one who had been
engaged in cleaning them, for a small can of
oil and some rags lay by them.  The lads lost
no time in pouncing on their finds.
</p>

<p>
Both proved to be loaded, and were of heavy
caliber and of business-like looking blued steel.
</p>

<p>
"Look wicked enough for anything," grinned
Sandy, examining his.  "I don't know about the
law-and-order aspect of this, but&mdash;'necessity
knows no law.'"
</p>

<p>
"We would really be justified in doing anything
to those ruffians," spoke Jack indignantly,
"for all they cared, we might have died of hunger
and thirst and suffocation in that miserable
hole yonder, without a soul coming near us.  I
feel like facing the whole crew of the ruffianly
wretches."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, let 'em come on," quoth Sandy defiantly,
brandishing his pistol.
</p>

<p>
As if in answer to his words, a door at the
head of a short flight of stairs was suddenly
flung open, and the figure of a man appeared
framed in the portal.
</p>

<p>
"Now for it," whispered Sandy.  He was glad
to note that in the hand which Jack impulsively
thrust out to meet his, there was no sign of
tremor.
</p>

<p>
Both lads flung themselves into attitudes of
defense.  Come what might, they felt prepared
to face it, nerved by a sense of their wrongs, and
of what a return to that pestilential hold would
mean.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap09"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER IX.
<br /><br />
"FIFTY DOLLARS TO THE MAN THAT GETS THEM!"
</h3>

<p>
The newcomer was Captain Rangler.
</p>

<p>
He was descending into the hold to get the
pistols he had barely finished cleaning and
loading, when the preparations for anchoring
brought a hurry call for him to go on deck.
</p>

<p>
His amazement at seeing both the lads free of
their handcuffs, and defiantly pointing the pistols
at his head, may be imagined.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'll be hanged!" he exclaimed, pausing
on the third step.  "What under the North Star
does this mean?"
</p>

<p>
"It means that you must set us free at once,"
spoke up Jack.  "We are at anchor now.  Send
us ashore in a boat."
</p>

<p>
"And what if I don't?" demanded the captain.
His voice seemed to hold more of curiosity than
the ferocity the boys had been prepared for.
</p>

<p>
The question was rather a puzzling one, and
caught the lads at a disadvantage.  They had
calculated on meeting with resistance.  Instead,
the captain of the tug, while appearing to be
much astonished at their cleverness in escaping
from their captivity, didn't seem to be in any
way inclined to offer them violence.
</p>

<p>
Instead, he sat down deliberately on one of
the steps, while both boys, rather perturbed in
mind, kept their pistols steadily leveled.  But
their hands were shaky.  They had been prepared
for anything but this, and it took them
aback.
</p>

<p>
"Well?" said Captain Rangler.
</p>

<p>
He drew a pipe from his mouth, and leisurely
filled and lighted it before Jack found words to
reply.
</p>

<p>
"Are you going to set us ashore?" he questioned
in as determined a voice as he could summon.
</p>

<p>
"Certainly we are," was the astonishing reply.
"What's the matter with you kids, anyhow?"
</p>

<p>
"What did you lock us in that hold for, and
almost starve us and nearly let us die of thirst in
that foul hole?" choked out Sandy.
</p>

<p>
Captain Rangler assumed a cleverly imitated
look of astonishment.
</p>

<p>
"Were you locked up in there?" he demanded.
</p>

<p>
"Of course we were; as if you didn't know it,"
blurted out Jack.
</p>

<p>
"Now, now, just hold your horses," counseled
the captain.  "If you were locked in there, I
knew nothing of it.  Dampier and Walstein
promised me no violence would be offered you if
I kidnapped you for them."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, so you do admit capturing us on that
lumber dock at Rockport?" sarcastically inquired
Sandy.
</p>

<p>
"Of course I do; I can't deny that," said the
captain with cool effrontery, "but Dampier and
Walstein spun me a yarn about you being two
runaway sons of some relatives of theirs and that
you had stolen quite a sum of money."
</p>

<p>
"In that case then, you ought to be our friend,"
struck in Jack.  "We are not runaways at all,
but lads out on a pleasure trip, and besides,
Dampier and Walstein are old enemies of my uncle.
They think he wronged them, and are taking
this means of avenging themselves."
</p>

<p>
"Humph," said the captain thoughtfully,
emitting a cloud of blue smoke from his lips, "so
them two fellers wasn't telling me the truth
either, eh?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course not.  They are two of the biggest
rascals at large.  They&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Jack got no further.  A strong arm was
thrown about him from behind.  At the same
instant Sandy was tripped and thrown flat.  The
captain burst into a roar of laughter, and sprang
down the stairs toward them.  His smoking of
the pipe had been a signal to those above that
all was not well below, and Dampier and Walstein
had silently descended by another way, and,
sneaking through the hold, had accomplished
this disastrous rear attack.  Captain Rangler, as
the lads might have guessed, had been merely
talking against time, to allow his accomplices to
descend into the cabin from another direction.
The column of smoke from his pipe, curling out
of the companion-way, had done its duty well&mdash;too well.
</p>

<p>
But both Jack and Sandy were strong, wiry
lads.  Though their activity had been much
impaired by the hardships they had gone through
during the night, there was still a lot of fight left
in them, as their attackers soon discovered.
</p>

<p>
With a quick twist, Jack freed himself from
Dampier, and thrust the pistol&mdash;which he still
held&mdash;into the rascal's face.  Dampier, who was
an arrant coward at heart, as are most men of
his stripe, shrank back.  His face was a sickly,
pasty yellow.
</p>

<p>
"D-d-d-d-don't shoot!" he begged, trembling.
</p>

<p>
Jack looked as fierce as he could, and flourished
his pistol at Walstein, who was struggling with
Sandy.
</p>

<p>
The leonine-headed ex-sea captain took the
hint, and joined Dampier in begging the lad not
to shoot.
</p>

<p>
But, in the excitement of this dramatic scene,
Jack had forgotten all about Captain Rangler.
As Walstein relaxed his hold on Sandy, Rangler
jumped forward, aiming a terrific blow at Jack's
head.  The lad ducked just in time, and the huge,
knotted fist whistled harmlessly over his head.
</p>

<p>
At the same instant, Sandy, with quick-witted
comprehension of the requirements of the situation,
dashed straight at Captain Rangler before
that worthy could recover from the astonishment
of his missed blow.  Straight between the giant's
legs hurtled Sandy's agile red-headed form.
Caught all unawares, Captain Rangler went
down with a crash.  His great weight, as he
fell, caused the cabin table to collapse, and
brought the whole thing down in a pile of
wreckage.
</p>

<p>
"Quick, Jack, before they recover their wits!"
exclaimed Sandy, dashing for the companionway.
</p>

<p>
Jack sprinted after him.  Up they dashed,
three steps at a time, and before the group below
recovered from their astonishment, the two lads
had gained the deck.
</p>

<p>
Apparently nobody had heard the noise of
the struggle, for the deck was deserted.
</p>

<p>
"What now?" asked Jack pantingly, as they
paused, undecided for an instant.
</p>

<p>
"See, there's a boat astern.  We'll make for
that!" shouted Sandy, heading off at top speed.
</p>

<p>
The tug lay at anchor about a hundred yards
off a well-timbered shore.  As well as the boys
could judge in their haste, the anchorage was
in a sort of steeply-walled cove.  But they hadn't
much time to take in details as they ran.
</p>

<p>
"What are you going to do?" panted Jack,
as they sprinted past the smokestack.
</p>

<p>
"Get in that boat and row ashore.  It's our
only chance.  They'll half kill us if they
capture us again."
</p>

<p>
"But&mdash;but suppose it's an island and there
are no folks living there?"
</p>

<p>
"We must chance that.  Come on now!  Over
this rail and drop into the boat.  We&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Hold on there, young fellows!  Where are
you coming to?"
</p>

<p>
The burly form of a sailor, who had been
taking a nap in the boat tied astern, suddenly
upreared itself from the stern sheets, just as
the lads had their legs over the rail and were
prepared to drop into it.
</p>

<p>
"We have orders from the captain to go
ashore instantly," spoke Sandy swiftly.
</p>

<p>
"Ah!  Get out with that gammon," was the
disconcerting reply, "you're the two kids we
catched in Rockport.  You&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Catch those boys!  Hold them!"
</p>

<p>
"Fifty dollars to the man that gets them!"
</p>

<p>
"Don't let them escape!"
</p>

<p>
Uttering these and similar cries, Walstein,
Dampier and Captain Rangler came pouring out
of the companionway in the bow.  At the same
instant half a dozen sailors appeared, as if by
magic, from various spots where they had been
taking quiet naps.
</p>

<p>
The sailor in the boat comprehended instantly.
</p>

<p>
"Get back!" he ordered gruffly, "you've
escaped.  You've got no&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The rest of his words were lost to posterity
forever, for Sandy had dropped nimbly into the
boat, followed by Jack.  Their sudden weight
tipped it to one side.
</p>

<p>
The sailor, who had been standing erect, toppled
over with a splash and a yell.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-100"></a>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-100.jpg" alt="&quot;Pull!  Pull for your life!&quot; shouted Sandy." />
<br />
&quot;Pull!  Pull for your life!&quot; shouted Sandy.
</p>

<p>
"Pull!  pull for your life!" shouted Sandy,
laying hold of an oar.  Jack needed no second order,
but picked up another.  Both lads tugged away
for dear life.  In the meantime, the sailor, who
could swim well, had laid hold of a rope and
pulled himself back on board the tug.
</p>

<p>
The lads had not got a dozen yards from the
tug's side before Walstein's voice came across
the water:
</p>

<p>
"Come back to the tug instantly!" he yelled
from where he stood, amidst quite a crowd of
the crew at the stern of the craft.
</p>

<p>
"We're in a hurry, thank you!" hailed back
Sandy, defiantly.
</p>

<p>
"See you some other time," called Jack, equally
recklessly.  The spirit of their exciting dash
was in their veins.  Both boys would have faced
anything rather than return to the tug just then.
</p>

<p>
"We'll be ashore in a few minutes," encouraged
Sandy as they pulled at the oars till the
stout ash wood bent like whalebone.
</p>

<p>
"I rather guess we&mdash;" Jack began, when
something happened to cut him short.
</p>

<p>
That "something" was a shower of bullets that
pattered all about them.  In their haste they had
not reckoned on this.
</p>

<p>
"Better stop rowing," yelled Walstein's bellowing
voice, "the next ones are going to hit closer."
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap10"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER X.
<br /><br />
A TRAP OF NATURE'S MAKING.
</h3>

<p>
"Dive overboard when I give the word and
swim under water!" ordered Sandy.
</p>

<p>
"The only thing to do, I guess.  Look, they
are going to fire again."
</p>

<p>
"Get ready, then."
</p>

<p>
Jack merely nodded.  But his lips were firmly
compressed, and his face bore a look of
determination that spoke far louder than words.
</p>

<p>
"Are you coming back, or do we have to sink
that boat and drown you two rats?" bellowed
Walstein, deliberately steadying his arm on the
stern bulwark of the tug to take better aim.
</p>

<p>
But before the words were out of his mouth
the boat was empty.  It seemed almost as if by
magic, so swiftly had both boys dived,
immediately following Sandy's quick-spoken:
</p>

<p>
"Now!"
</p>

<p>
A perfect roar of rage arose from the decks
of the anchored tug, as the two splashes sounded
and only spreading rings of water marked where
the lads had vanished.
</p>

<p>
"Fire at the water!" shouted Walstein, almost
beside himself with anger.
</p>

<p>
As for Dampier, he danced up and down, and
shook his fists at the shore in impotent fury.
</p>

<p>
"Guess the boys have euchered us this time,
Walstein," grinned Captain Rangler ruefully.
</p>

<p>
Among all that angry crew the captain alone
was cool.
</p>

<p>
"No use firing at the water," he continued, "it
will only be waste of ammunition.  Anyway,
those kids must be 'most ashore by this time."
</p>

<p>
A few seconds later two dripping forms did
emerge from the water, and, wading rapidly up
the beach, vanished in the thick undergrowth.
</p>

<p>
"And we haven't even got a boat to follow
them in!" raged Dampier.
</p>

<p>
"Well, there's the one that they stole floating
about.  Peterson," addressing one of the sailors,
"swim over yonder and bring that boat back."
</p>

<p>
The man kicked off his boots unconcernedly,
and stripped to his underclothing.  He was a
strong swimmer, and speedily returned with the
small craft.
</p>

<p>
"Now, then, get aboard," ordered Captain
Rangler.  "The sooner we take after them the
less chance those brats will have to travel any
distance."
</p>

<p>
"Yes; but supposing they discover the&mdash;the&mdash;you
know&mdash;the old tower?" questioned Dampier
uneasily.
</p>

<p>
"Pshaw!" scoffed Walstein, "no danger of
that.  It's too well hidden.  Besides, the light
hasn't been used, except for our purposes, for
years.  The path is all overgrown, and nobody
who didn't know the way could reach it."
</p>

<p>
"Just the same, it would be awkward if they
did, and were ever able to inform the
authorities," spoke up one of the crew.
</p>

<p>
"That's so.  But in that case they would never
get away.  Eh, Rangler?"
</p>

<p>
It was Dampier who spoke, his thin, ferret-like
features contorted in an evil smile.
</p>

<p>
"I'm sure I don't know," rejoined Captain
Rangler, as if the subject was distasteful to him,
"but there's another reason.  You know what
that is."
</p>

<p>
"Of course.  But Barkentin is guarding him.
Come on, let's waste no more time talking here,
but get ashore."
</p>

<p>
Five minutes later, as many as could crowd
into the boat were being pulled toward the little
beach where the boys had landed.  In the stern
sheets sat Walstein, Dampier and Captain Rangler,
the most bitter enemies the two young
fugitives had on earth.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
The ground above the beach sloped quite
steeply.  It was rocky and thickly grown with
brush and low shrubs, and here and there large
trees mingled with the undergrowth.
</p>

<p>
Stumbling and running by turns, the two
young fugitives made their way over the uneven
ground with some difficulty.  But the thought
of what lay behind kept them moving as briskly
as possible.  At last the character of the ground
seemed to change.  They emerged on a sort of
rocky plateau.
</p>

<p>
At one side of this was a cliff, and at the base
of the acclivity appeared a large hole, apparently
the mouth of a cave.
</p>

<p>
"We may as well take a look in there," spoke
Jack; "in case of pursuit it might make a good
hiding place."
</p>

<p>
Sandy agreed that the cave was worth investigating.
But before the two lads plunged into
the dark entrance of the place they armed
themselves with heavy sticks.  Later they were glad
they had taken this precaution.
</p>

<p>
The mouth of the cave was black and a curious
damp smell issued from it.  But the boys did
not hesitate.  With Jack in advance, they plunged
into the tunnel-like entrance.  The floor of the
cavern sloped steeply downward and was dry
and sandy.  It was pitchy dark inside, but,
luckily, Sandy had a small electric pocket lamp
with him, which he flashed about.  It showed
the boys that they were making their way
through a sort of semi-circular tube in the cliff.
Just how far it extended they were, of course,
unaware; but they decided to keep pushing on
until they came to the end of it.
</p>

<p>
All at once the rocky passage terminated
abruptly in a medium sized chamber with a high
roof.  The air in here was cool and pleasant,
and the boys sat down to rest on a rock while
they looked about them in the rays of the pocket
lamp.
</p>

<p>
"This is a queer sort of place to stumble on,"
mused Jack; "wonder if anyone ever explored
it before."
</p>

<p>
"I dinna ken," rejoined Sandy, "but, mon, I
can spy another openin' yonder.  Suppose that
when we are rested we see what is beyant."
</p>

<p>
"Very well," agreed Jack readily.  "As far
as that goes, I'm ready to start right now."
</p>

<p>
Sandy declared that he was rested too, and the
lads crossed the rocky chamber and plunged into
another passage on the other side.  It was similar
in character to the tunnel through which they
had entered the big cavern, except that its
downward slope was pitched still more steeply.
</p>

<p>
"I wonder where on earth this is going to lead
us?" ruminated Jack as they trudged along.
</p>

<p>
"We must ha' come more than half a mile
noo," grunted out Sandy.
</p>

<p>
"Tired?" asked Jack.
</p>

<p>
"A little."
</p>

<p>
"Well, we might as well turn back then.  I
don't think it's much use our keeping on any
further."
</p>

<p>
"Nor do I.  Besides, we might get lost, and
it's fearsome dark in case that light gives oot,
and I dinna think the batteries are verra strong."
</p>

<p>
This suggested an alarming possibility to Jack.
He knew that Sandy had used the torch a good
deal and, as the Scotch lad had pointed out, there
was a chance that the light might not hold out.
In such a case their predicament would be a
serious one, indeed.
</p>

<p>
The lads turned and retraced their steps and,
in the course of a few minutes, found themselves
back in the vaulted chamber.  Here they sat down
to rest once more.  While they rested the light
was extinguished, but, as it was lonely sitting
there in the dark, Sandy felt moved to relate
a story of an adventure met with by a friend of
his father's in a mine in the west.
</p>

<p>
This man was an engineer who had been called
upon to do some inspection work on a large mine
which extended several hundred feet under the
ground.
</p>

<p>
"Being doon here in the dark sets me in mind
of it," added the lad.  "Shall I tell ye aboot it?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, do," rejoined Jack.  "It will help to pass
the time while we are resting up."
</p>

<p>
Without further preliminaries Sandy plunged
into his story, which we shall not relate in his
dialect, but set forth in plain English.
</p>

<p>
The hero of Sandy's tale was a young engineer
named MacPherson.  On the day on which he
met with his adventure he had completed a tour
of inspection of the lower levels of the works
and was invited by one of the employees to take
a look at a vein which was located in a far part
of the mine.
</p>

<p>
Accompanied by this employee, MacPherson
set off to the remote excavation in which the vein
was located.  All the time they were below the
ore trucks, operated by a cable from above, were
ascending and descending at a rapid rate.  On
returning from his investigation of the vein the
engineer and his friend stopped for a time to
watch the trucks as they rushed up and down.
</p>

<p>
All at once MacPherson noticed that a truck
of a different type to the others was coming
toward them.  It was painted a bright red.  He
inquired what it was, and was informed that it
was the dynamite car which took a supply of the
explosive to another part of the mine where the
men were opening up a new lead.
</p>

<p>
"Pretty awkward if it should happen to bump
us," remarked MacPherson with a grin.
</p>

<p>
His companion answered with a shrug.
</p>

<p>
"We'd never know what struck us," he said.
"There's enough dynamite in that car to blow up
half the mountain if it ever jumped the track."
</p>

<p>
The words were hardly out of his mouth before
a miner came running through the tunnel
toward them.
</p>

<p>
"A truck has been wrecked round the curve,
just below the shaft," he cried.  "I'm going to
telephone to the surface and tell 'em to stop that
dynamite car.  If it&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He stopped abruptly and his jaw fell.  At that
instant the red car flashed past with a rumble and
roar, and shot round the curve at high speed.
</p>

<p>
"Down on your faces!" shouted the miner
excitedly; and down on their faces they all three
flung themselves without loss of time.  Hardly
had they done so before there was a roar that
seemed to shake the earth to its foundations.
The lights on the wall of the tunnel went out,
and the three men were raised from the ground
and slammed down again with sufficient violence
to knock the breath out of them.
</p>

<p>
MacPherson was the first to recover himself.
But the other two regained their faculties speedily
and, sitting up, strove to collect their scattered
senses.  They were in pitch darkness, and only
MacPherson had any matches in his pockets.
These were struck sparingly as they groped their
way along the tunnel.  But before they had gone
more than a few yards they were brought up
"all standing" by a mass of rock.  It had been
dislodged by the explosion, and lay in great
masses, completely blocking the tunnel and, as
they realized, with thrills of horror, imprisoning
them.
</p>

<p>
Luckily they were all men of nerve, and,
instead of losing their senses, began to calculate
ways and means of escape.  But their deliberations
brought them to no satisfactory conclusion.
</p>

<p>
Before them lay a wall whose thickness they
had no means of knowing.  Behind them the
tunnel terminated at the vein already mentioned.
They were prisoners, hundreds of feet under the
earth, and how were they to know if they would
ever be rescued, or even if any attempt would
be made to do so.
</p>

<p>
As they realized this, despair overtook all three
of them for a time.  For a long period they sat,
gloomily, in the darkness, without speaking.
Then, all at once, reaching out his hand,
MacPherson touched an iron pipe.  He informed the
others of his discovery and the miner declared
that the metal tube led to the surface and was
used to convey water to the depths of the mine.
This suggested an idea to MacPherson.  He
picked up a bit of rock and began tapping at
the pipe.  He had some knowledge of telegraphy,
and the taps he gave spelled out the message:
</p>

<p>
"Three of us are imprisoned.  Send help."
</p>

<p>
After a time he succeeded in teaching the message
to the others, and they took turns in tapping
it out.  But no reply came, and in despair they
gave up their efforts for a time.
</p>

<p>
But MacPherson was not prepared to lose
hope as easily as the others.  He persisted in his
tapping, hour after hour, till the rock he was
tapping with cut his hands and they were bruised
and sore.  He was just about to give over his
efforts to attract attention when there came a
sudden sound that made his pulses jump.
</p>

<p>
Somebody was tapping an answer from above.
MacPherson listened and made out the message.
</p>

<p>
"Where are you?"
</p>

<p>
"What do you call this tunnel?" he asked of
the miner.
</p>

<p>
"Tunnel No. 4 of the Old Mine," was the reply
in a listless tone.  "Why?"
</p>

<p>
"Why?  Because I've just got an answer to
my message.  There is a chance we may be
saved."
</p>

<p>
The reply electrified the despairing men into
new hope.  They listened eagerly while
MacPherson tapped out a return message.
</p>

<p>
"We are in Tunnel No. 4 of the Old Mine,"
he rapped out.
</p>

<p>
Then they waited for the answer.  It seemed
an age before it came to the entombed men.
</p>

<p>
"Will try to get help to you.  But the
explosion has blocked the shaft."
</p>

<p>
With this they had to be content, but the man
above continued, from time to time, to send down
bulletins of what was being done.  In this way
he announced the work of the relief parties, and
described the damage done by the explosion.
Three men had been killed, he said, but the others
had managed to escape, although more or less
wounded.  When the first wreck occurred they
had at once made for the upper levels, not
waiting for the arrival of the dynamite car, which
they knew must be on its way.  In this manner
they had saved themselves from death.
</p>

<p>
After that there seemed nothing more to do
but to await, with what patience they might, the
work of rescue.  But they knew full well that
if help didn't come before long they were
doomed to die of hunger and thirst, for already
they were beginning to feel the pangs of privation.
</p>

<p>
Water particularly was what they longed for.
It was hot, stiflingly so, in their living tomb,
and there appeared no prospect of speedy relief.
They tried in vain to get at the fluid that they
knew was inside the pipe, but, having no tools,
their efforts were useless, and would not have
been attempted by any but desperate men, such
as they were fast becoming.
</p>

<p>
At first they kept track of the time, but after
awhile their store of matches grew so low that
they did not dare light them to examine their
watches.  To make matters worse, no answer
now came to MacPherson's tappings, and so they
were deprived of the means of knowing how the
work above them was going on.
</p>

<p>
Hour after hour passed in the darkness, and
the nerves of the imprisoned captives were
cruelly racked.  But suddenly a sound broke in
on the silence.
</p>

<p>
It was a queer sort of scraping sound among the
great mass of rock that was blocking the tunnel.
Then, to the wonderment of the imprisoned men,
a voice came through the darkness with startling
clearness.  To their overwrought imaginations
it seemed almost supernatural for an instant.
But the next moment the mysterious incident was
explained.
</p>

<p>
The rescuing party, working on the other side
of the blockade, had succeeded in forcing a pipe
through the rock.  Through this they were now
addressing the captives.  Before long the pipe
served a new use.  Water and food in liquid form
were forced through it, the imprisoned men
taking turns at getting their nourishment in this
odd fashion.
</p>

<p>
For three days they were compelled to live
in this manner, while their comrades worked
desperately to pierce the barrier.  At last it was
accomplished, and rescued and rescuers met face
to face.  Amid cheers the survivors of the
accident were brought to the surface.
</p>

<p>
It was then that a strange thing was seen.
Their hair had turned white as snow from
suspense and suffering, but otherwise, except that
they looked thin and haggard, they showed no
permanent effects of their terrible experience.
</p>

<p>
"And when I find mesel' in a tight place,"
concluded Sandy, "I think to mesel' of
MacPherson and his comrades in yon black hole."
</p>

<p>
Jack agreed that the experience of the
engineer and his companions was indeed an
example of something turning up when everything
seemed at its blackest, but he could not help but
think that their own situation was almost as bad.
</p>

<p>
A short time after, they rose to their feet and
struck out for the passage by which they had
entered the big cavern.  As Sandy switched on
the light, however, they both became aware of
something that made them jump back in a hurry.
</p>

<p>
A big black snake was coiled on the floor of
the cave, almost at their feet.  Another step, in
fact, and they would have trodden on the reptile.
As they jumped backward, with the agility of
acrobats, the snake hissed angrily and, opening
its mouth, showed a forked, darting tongue and
ugly-looking fangs.
</p>

<p>
Sandy aimed a blow at the creature with his
stick, but, instead of recoiling, the reptile made
as if to strike at the lad.  Just then, as the Scotch
lad's misfortune would have it, he tripped on
a rock and fell forward.
</p>

<p>
He uttered an involuntary yell as he did so.
He could almost feel, in imagination, the fangs
of the black snake fastening into his flesh.
Naturally, too, in his extremity, he dropped his pocket
light, which went out immediately, being one of
the variety that are worked by keeping a finger
pressed on a spring.
</p>

<p>
Plunged once more in Egyptian darkness, with
his companion, for all he knew, involved in a
battle with the serpent, Jack caught his breath.
Then he struck a match.  The sputter of flame
showed him Sandy sprawled out at full length
on the ground, while the snake had its head drawn
back and its body coiled as if to strike.
</p>

<p>
At that instant the match flickered and went
out.  But Jack had marked where the snake lay,
and, in a desperate effort to save Sandy at all
hazards, he struck out blindly in the darkness.
He felt his stick strike something soft and
wriggly.  The feeling sent a shudder of
repulsion through the boy, but he bravely kept on
striking out nevertheless.  In the meantime Sandy
had recovered himself, and, feeling about for it,
found the pocket light.  He switched it hastily
on and saw Jack battling with the black snake,
which was hissing and striking viciously in every
direction.
</p>

<p>
It was Sandy's turn to take part in the battle
now.  With a well-directed blow he brought his
stick down full on the serpent's back.  Instantly
the creature seemed to tie itself up in an intricate
knot, writhing and lashing in what proved its
death agony, for a few seconds later it lay in
a limp, inanimate heap at the lad's feet.
</p>

<p>
"Well done, Sandy," cried Jack, examining the
dead reptile.  "It's dead as a doornail."
</p>

<p>
"I wonder if it was a poisonous one?"
pondered Sandy.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know.  It looks deadly enough, and
I'd hate to have been bitten by it," rejoined Jack,
"but come on.  Don't let's waste time here.  We
must push on in a hurry if we want to get out
again before that lamp gives out."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, it's getting a wee bit feeble," agreed
Sandy.  "Hoots, mon, I hope it dinna give oot.
If it does before we reach the open air we shall
be&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The sentence was not completed.  At that
instant the dreaded thing happened.  Without any
warning the wires in the tiny lamp began to
glow red and then suddenly ceased to shine.  The
boys were plunged in total darkness, and, worse
still, Jack's supply of matches was exhausted.
</p>

<p>
"What on earth shall we do?" he breathed,
with something of a quiver in his voice.
</p>

<p>
In rejoinder Sandy felt for his comrade's hand
and clasped it.
</p>

<p>
"Dinna lose heart, laddie," he said.  "Remember
the story o' MacPherson and keep up your
courage."
</p>

<p>
Thus admonished, Jack steadied up his nerves,
and the two lads began to grope through the
darkness.
</p>

<p>
"We can find the wall of the cave and then
feel round it till we discover the opening," said
jack in a firmer voice than when he had last
spoken.
</p>

<p>
"Hurray!  Here it is!" exclaimed Sandy after
they had groped about for several minutes.
</p>

<p>
"Then, forward march!" cried Jack, "and let's
get out of this place as quick as we can.  I wish
we had never come into it."
</p>

<p>
"So do I," agreed Sandy, "but it's crying when
the milk is spilt."
</p>

<p>
Through the darkness the two boys advanced
into the tunnel whose entrance they had
discovered.  They tramped briskly on for some time
and at last a feeble glimmer of light began to
show.  This heartened them, and they quickened
their steps.  At last they reached the mouth of
the tunnel they had been traversing.
</p>

<p>
But at its end a cruel shock awaited them.
</p>

<p>
Instead of the rocky plateau they had expected
to find, they discovered that they had emerged
on the lip of a cliff.  Peering over the edge, they
could see that they were standing on a sort of
shelf, a good hundred feet above the bottom of
a steep-sided ravine.
</p>

<p>
The opposite side of the abyss was not more
than twenty feet distant, but how were they to
cross it?
</p>

<p>
"We must turn back," said Jack in a voice
tinged with despair.
</p>

<p>
But Sandy shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"We could ne'er find the right passage again,"
he said.  "There must be several of them branching
oot of that cavern.  Mon, it's tough luck that
we took the wrong ane, but we must aye try to
find a way oot of our deefeculties."
</p>

<p>
"It's too wide to jump it," said Jack despairingly,
"and unless we do that I don't see how
we can get across."
</p>

<p>
"Nor do I&mdash;yet," said Sandy, looking about
him with sharp, intent eyes.
</p>

<p>
But all at once he gave a joyous cry.
</p>

<p>
"We could get across if we had a bit bridge,"
he said.
</p>

<p>
"Why don't you wish for an airship while you
are at it?" retorted Jack.  "It would be just as
easy to get one as to find a bridge."
</p>

<p>
"I'm nae so sure aboot that noo," said Sandy,
with a grin.  "See yon dead tree on the hillside
above?"
</p>

<p>
Jack looked up and saw that, just above the
tunnel mouth, the ground sloped steeply upward,
and that rooted in the loose soil was the dead
trunk of a lightning-blasted pine.
</p>

<p>
"If we could get that doon," said Sandy, "and
make it fall so as it reached across yon hole in
the ground, we'd have a bridge."
</p>

<p>
"Cracky!  So we would.  But how are we to
get it down?  We've no axe, and it would take
a week to cut it down with our knives."
</p>

<p>
Sandy thought deeply for a while.  Then he spoke.
</p>

<p>
"That wood is dead and dry.  If we could get
a bit fire at the roots, doon she'd coom in a jiffy."
</p>

<p>
"But we've no matches."
</p>

<p>
"Can ye no think of any other way to make fire?"
</p>

<p>
Jack shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"In books people always rub dry sticks together,
but I've tried that often, and I could never
get even a spark from them."
</p>

<p>
Sandy drew a small brass object from his
pocket.  Jack saw at once that it was one of the
Scotch lad's most treasured possessions&mdash;a
pocket microscope.  Many a bug, beetle and butterfly
had yielded up their lives on its account.
</p>

<p>
"There's a good hot sun aboot us," quoth
Sandy; "noo I wonder if we canna make a good
burning glass oot of this wee microscope?"
</p>

<p>
"By ginger!  That's a plan worth trying!" cried
Jack enthusiastically.
</p>

<p>
He began climbing the hillside to where the
dead pine grew.  With their knives the two boys
soon had shaved off enough dried bark to start
their experiment.  Dead limbs in plenty lay all
about.
</p>

<p>
The bark was piled up in a heap after having
been shredded.  Then Sandy held his microscope
up between the sun and the pile of dried tinder.
After a little he managed to concentrate a red
hot ray on the tinder.  It began to smoke, and
an aromatic scent filled the air.  The boys could
not restrain their enthusiasm.  Jack lay flat and
blew on the smoldering bits of bark till they
burst into flame.  In a few minutes a roaring
fire was heaped about the base of the old dead
pine.
</p>

<p>
A long, thick limb, broken off in some winter
storm, lay not far off.  The boys secured this,
and when they thought the fire had burned long
enough to char the base of the tree thoroughly,
they began using it as a battering ram.
</p>

<p>
"Now then," cried Sandy, "ane! twa! all together!"
</p>

<p>
Crash!  The improvised ram collided with the
old pine's partially rotted trunk.
</p>

<p>
"Glory!  It's shaking!" yelled Jack.  "A few
more good whacks like that and down she comes."
</p>

<p>
Bang!  Bang!  Bang!  Bang! went the battering
ram.  The old pine began to lean over
majestically.  Slowly, very slowly, its collapse
progressed.  All at once its weight tore it apart from
its base, and it fell with a loud, resounding crash.
The boys caught their breath.  Would its outer
end touch the other side of the chasm?
</p>

<p>
The next instant a jubilant cheer announced
that it had fulfilled the hoped for purpose.  Jack
threw his cap in the air.  Sandy did the same.
</p>

<p>
"It's a regular Brooklyn bridge the noo!" he
exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
Half scrambling and half sliding, the boys lost
no time in descending to their improvised bridge.
It required some exercise of courage to straddle
the not over steady trunk, and work their way
across it to the other side, but it was done at
last, and they stood once more on "safe ground."
</p>

<p>
"Now, then, what will we do?" demanded Jack.
</p>

<p>
"Strike out through yon woods.  It can't be
long before we get to some house or other,"
declared Sandy stoutly.
</p>

<p>
With a last glance at the "bridge" that had
served them so well in what had seemed an
insurmountable difficulty, the boys pushed forward,
making their way through country very much
like that they had traversed before they came
to the cave and an adventure which had come
near costing them dearly.
</p>

<p>
"Say, this brush is as thick as a fog on Long
Island Sound," vociferated Jack, as the two lads
pushed perspiringly forward through dense
undergrowth, interspersed by huge tree trunks
whose tops towered high above.
</p>

<p>
"But we've got to keep on going," remonstrated
Sandy, "reminds me of that yarn of the
chap who said he'd an ancestor who fought in
the revolutionary war on the British side.  They
asked him what his ancestor did, and the chap
said that he had a drum and kept on beating it."
</p>

<p>
"Hum! that's what we've got to do, 'keep on
beating it,'" was Jack's comment on the
perennially cheerful Sandy's anecdote.
</p>

<p>
On and on they pushed, from time to time
encountering small clearings, and then again
plunging into thick woods.  The sun grew higher
and it grew hotter, but neither of the lads gave
a sign of the fatigue that he felt.  But their
clothes were dripping wet, as well as torn by the
rough going they encountered.
</p>

<p>
At last Jack sat down on a big log on the
edge of a particularly dense bit of woodland.
</p>

<p>
"Tuckered out, mon?" inquired Sandy.
</p>

<p>
"No, far from it.  I could keep on for quite
a while, but&mdash;but&mdash;say, Sandy, I wonder where
on earth we are, anyway.  Is this an island, or
the mainland, or the United States or Canada, or
what?"
</p>

<p>
"Blessed if I know," was the frank response,
"our only plan is to keep plugging along till we
find out.  If it's an island it must be a big one,
or we would have come to the other side of it
by this time."
</p>

<p>
"That's so," assented Jack, "unless we've been
traveling round and round in circles."
</p>

<p>
"Pshaw! only babies and folks in books do
that.  I've kept my eyes on the sun and I'm
pretty sure we've been keeping in one direction
right along."
</p>

<p>
"That being the case, I move that we continue
to do so."
</p>

<p>
"Very well.  Lay on, MacDuff, arise and gird
thy loins, and&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Sandy, as he spoke, had given a step or two
forward into some marshy-looking land that
came almost up to the stump on which they had
been resting.
</p>

<p>
All at once, before Jack's very eyes, the Scotch
lad gave an amazed, choking exclamation, and
without warning, was suddenly immersed to his
waist in the center of a patch of unnaturally
brilliant green grass.
</p>

<p>
"Help, Jack!  Help!" he cried in a voice in
which real terror vibrated.
</p>

<p>
"What is it?  What's the matter?" queried
Jack, anxiously springing forward.  This was a
new disaster, and a very real one.
</p>

<p>
"It's&mdash;it's a quicksand or something!" gasped
Sandy, "it's pulling me down!  Help!  I&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
As he spoke he struggled desperately in the
grip of the quagmire that had fastened a
remorseless hold on his nether limbs.  But every
struggle took him lower.  The slimy, treacherous
black mud reached his waist, then it gradually
engulfed him till it was up to his chest.
</p>

<p>
Jack desperately hacked at a young tree with
his big pocketknife.  If he could reach Sandy
with it in time, he felt that he could save his
companion yet.
</p>

<p>
"Keep up your courage, Sandy," he kept on
saying, in a voice that would quaver a bit in
spite of itself, "I'll get you out of it, never fear."
</p>

<p>
"You'll have to hurry then, Jack," rejoined
the other lad in an astonishingly calm voice, "this
stuff is drawing me down as if it had hands."
</p>

<p>
At last the sapling was cut, and Jack hastened
to the edge of the swamp to extend it toward his
half-immersed companion.  Under his directions
Sandy clutched it with the grip of a drowning
man.
</p>

<p>
"Now, then," cried Jack, exerting every ounce
of his strength.  He tugged with might and
main, but Sandy still stuck fast.  It occurred to
Jack that, by getting closer to the boy he was
trying to help, he might be of more assistance.
Cautiously he ventured forward and then tried
another tug.
</p>

<p>
In order to make this final effort more
successful he had braced his feet against a stick of
solid-looking timber that lay in the morass.  But
it proved "a rotten reed."  As his weight came
against it the soft wood appeared literally to
"melt away."
</p>

<p>
Jack felt his feet slide from under him, and
then&mdash;horrifying sensation&mdash;something seemed
to grip them.  He struggled in vain.  A fly on
a sheet of sticky flypaper might have tried to
free itself as effectually.
</p>

<p>
The morass gave a queer, sucking sound, and
great bubbles of marsh gas rose to the surface
and broke as Jack floundered about.  But every
struggle served only to tighten his slimy bonds.
</p>

<p>
The quagmire had our two young fugitives
fast in its treacherous embrace.
</p>

<p>
"Help!" shouted Jack.
</p>

<p>
"Help!  Help!" echoed Sandy in a weak,
despairing voice.
</p>

<p>
No answer came back, except the scream of a
great blue heron which, alarmed by their cries,
arose and flapped lazily out of the slough.

<h3>
CHAPTER XI.
<br /><br />
OUT OF THE DARK.
</h3>

<p>
"It's no use.  They are too fast for us."
</p>

<p>
Jeff Trulliber spoke from the bridge of the
<i>Sea Ranger</i>, some hours after the chase across
the waters of Lake Huron had begun.
</p>

<p>
"It does look that way," said Tom, with a
sigh, gazing after the cloud of smoke on the
horizon which, fast as the <i>Sea Ranger</i> was urged,
never appeared to get any closer.
</p>

<p>
"The rascals!" exclaimed Professor Podsnap,
shaking his fist at the smoke cloud.
</p>

<p>
The events of the past few hours had transformed
the man of science from an abstracted,
dreamy individual, into quite a warlike, ferocious
being.  He could talk of nothing but the vengeance
he would like to wreak on Walstein and
Dampier had he them in his power.
</p>

<p>
"Dinnah am sub'bed!  Dinnah am sub'bed!
Dinnah am sub'bed!"
</p>

<p>
It was the voice of Rosewater, speaking, as
usual, in "threes."
</p>

<p>
"I haven't much appetite, but I suppose we
had better eat something," said Tom.  "Jeff, you
and the professor go first.  I'll take the wheel.
The engines won't need watching for a while."
</p>

<p>
Jeff was about to expostulate and urge Tom,
who looked tired and jaded, to go to the table, but
he suddenly recollected that the eldest Dacre lad
was now, to all intents and purposes, the captain
of the <i>Sea Ranger</i>.
</p>

<p>
So, with an "aye! aye, sir!" and a touch of his
cap, he hastened off with the professor to the
comfortable cabin astern.  Rosewater, considering
the short time he had been on board, had
certainly performed wonders in the culinary
department.  The table was properly spread with linen
and silver, and while we are not going to
describe the meal in detail, it was as good as could
have been obtained in any city hotel.
</p>

<p>
But, to the disappointment of the black, who
hovered solicitously over their chairs, neither
his master nor the professor ate much.  Their
conversation was more limited than their
appetites.  The strain under which they were
laboring was beginning to tell on them.
</p>

<p>
Nor did Tom, when he in his turn took his
place at the table, display any more ability as a
trencherman.  He knew the cruel, desperate
characters of the men who had captured Sandy
and Jack too well to hope for any good treatment
for his brother and his chum.  On the contrary,
he did not know to what sufferings they
might be put by their brutal captors, especially
as Tom's own escape must have enraged
Walstein and Dampier to the point of madness.
</p>

<p>
He speculated a good deal as to whether the
two rascals had carried out their intention of
writing a letter to his uncle, demanding ransom.
It seemed probable, but in the rush of events that
was coincident with the <i>Sea Ranger's</i> departure
from Rockport, Tom had no opportunity to find
out.  He had, however, ascertained that there
was a wireless station there, and at various other
points along the lakes, and he promised himself
that, at the first opportunity, he would take
advantage of this, to send Mr. Dacre a wireless
message.
</p>

<p>
"I only wish we had had the <i>Sea Ranger</i> so
equipped," mused Tom, who had taken considerable
interest in wireless at school, "I'm a pretty
fair sender and receiver myself, and if we'd only
had an apparatus I could have used it to advantage
right now.  For instance, I could have sent
out 'a general alarm' for those ruffians on the
tug."
</p>

<p>
Tom's meal, as may be supposed, did not take
long, and he soon left the table, which caused
Rosewater to remark, sotto voce:
</p>

<p>
"Dat boy am grievin'! dat boy am grievin'! dat
boy suttinly am grievin', when he kin jes
look at candied sweet potatoes an' say 'not
to-day, fank you'!"
</p>

<p>
During the afternoon the same relative distances
between the two craft were maintained.
But, as the sun grew lower, and hues of copper
and gold began to spread over the water Tom, on
a visit to the deck from his vigil over the
engines, noted, with keen joy, that they seemed
to be gaining a trifle.
</p>

<p>
"I'll try and squeeze a bit more speed out of
her," he promised, diving below and exercising
all his engineering ability to coax even a half a
knot more out of the laboring motors.
</p>

<p>
"How about it now?" he inquired, coming on
deck again a few moments later.
</p>

<p>
"Better and better," exclaimed Jeff exultingly,
"I can almost make out the outlines of the tug
now.  My! but she's burning coal!"
</p>

<p>
"She needs to," said Tom grimly, "if I ever
get my hands on those chaps!"
</p>

<p>
But darkness fell, and the grim race still kept
on.
</p>

<p>
It was one of those black nights that sometimes
come in summer, when the darkness is like
a velvety pall.  There is no need to describe the
chagrin of our friends.
</p>

<p>
"Maybe she'll show a light," said Jeff cheerily,
"we were close enough to her when the dark
shut in to see it if she does."
</p>

<p>
"But she won't," said Tom bitterly, "you may
depend on that."
</p>

<p>
"What! she'll risk running Mackinac&mdash;we
must be off there now,&mdash;without lights?"
</p>

<p>
"Those fellows would risk anything to keep
out of the clutches of the law," rejoined Tom
positively, "mark my words, they'll run the
Straits without showing a glimmer."
</p>

<p>
"They are taking desperate chances."
</p>

<p>
"Such rascals as they are have been taking
desperate chances all their lives," put in the
professor gravely.
</p>

<p>
"Well, how about us, Tom?" asked Jeff after
supper&mdash;a meal eaten with little more appetite
than dinner,&mdash;"are we going to keep on?"
</p>

<p>
"I suppose so.  I don't know that it is much
use, though.  In this darkness we are as likely
to get miles off our course as we are to stick to
their heels."
</p>

<p>
"I wish there were some way of making the
daylight twenty-four hours long when you
wanted it to be," said Jeff impatiently, peering
ahead with his hands on the wheel.
</p>

<p>
"We'd have to be further north for that," said
the professor, "to the north pole almost."
</p>

<p>
"Well, we'll go there, if necessary, to rescue
Jack and Sandy," declared Tom, with firm
conviction.
</p>

<p>
In the darkness the professor reached for
Tom's hand and found it.  He wrung it warmly.
Adversity brings men and boys wondrous close.
</p>

<p>
"That's the talk, Tom Dacre," he said heartily,
quite dropping his pedagogic air and speaking
simply and strongly.  "Although Providence
may sometimes seem to favor rascals, never fear
but that in the end she is on the side of honest
men."
</p>

<p>
"Dat's jus' what ah ses, sah, when dey excuses
me of stealin' dat ole Shanghai rooster down in
Barbadoes," struck in Rosewater, who happened
to be close by, "ah ses, 'Ah is white as de
dribben snow, yo' wushup.'  I nebber done go
fo' ter steal no chickens nohow.  Ah was
jes'&mdash;  Fo' de lub ob Moses, wha' am dat!"
</p>

<p>
The <i>Sea Ranger</i>, for the second time on that
trip, struck something, with a harsh, grating
sound.
</p>

<p>
Rosewater was thrown flat on his back and
rolled off the bridge, bumping down the steps
like a sack of potatoes.  The others only saved
themselves by clutching at the rail with might
and main.
</p>

<p>
"We've struck something!" shouted the professor.
</p>

<p>
"Back her!" yelled Jeff, madly spinning his
wheel over.  Tom had darted below at the
instant of the crash, and set the reverse levers.
Already the <i>Sea Ranger</i> began to swing
backward.  But her movements were slow, almost
like those of a crippled animal.
</p>

<p>
"Hey, there!" hailed a fresh, youthful voice
out of the darkness ahead, "what have we hit?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, what do you think you've hit?" bellowed
Jeff indignantly, "an ice-cream parlor?"

<p>
"Who are you, anyhow?" shouted the professor,
peering forward into the darkness that
lay about them.  There was no light ahead or in
any other direction to indicate the location of
the craft that had hit them.
</p>

<p>
"Ya-as, sah, dawggone yo' alls!" bellowed
Rosewater aggressively, "who am you?  Das
wha' we wan' ter be infummed upon."
</p>

<p>
"Hope I haven't injured you," came a pleasant
voice once more, "I'm awfully sorry.  But as
I was coming up&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Coming up?" exclaimed Tom, who had by
this time rejoined the party on the bridge,
having stopped the engine, "coming up?  What do
you mean?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, what I say.  As I was coming up from
the bottom of the lake I&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Say, have we collided with a floating
lunatic asylum?" howled Jeff.
</p>

<p>
"Well," came back the amused voice, "folks
have said I was crazy, but I guess my trial trip
will show that there was some method in my
madness.  The submarine <i>Huron</i> is as complete
a success as I could wish.  And&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"A submarine!" yelled Jeff.  "Howling
mud-turtles!  We've hit a submarine!"
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid it was I who hit you," came back
the voice out of the darkness.  "I find one of
my top plates is dented, and&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Fo! de lub ob goodness!  De cabin am full
ob water!"
</p>

<p>
Rosewater, who had been making an investigation,
came flying to the bridge.
</p>

<p>
"Good gracious, that means we are leaking
badly," cried Tom, "what will happen next on
this unlucky cruise!  Jeff, wait here.  I'm off to
see."
</p>

<p>
Tom found, as Rosewater had said, that there
was indeed water in the cabin,&mdash;about a foot of
it.  It seemed to be gaining fast.  But, after a
rapid survey of the situation, Tom became
convinced that the leak was in the bow, and that
the water was running aft because of the lower
situation of that part of his craft.
</p>

<p>
This conclusion reached, he hastened on deck.
By this time he found that the mysterious
submarine, of which they had not yet had a view,
was alongside.  Her skipper, who had explained
that his name was Obadiah Ironsides, was shouting
something up to Jeff just as Tom appeared
on the scene.
</p>

<p>
"There's a big, jagged hole in your bow."
</p>

<p>
Tom peered over and speedily saw that this
was so.
</p>

<p>
"Get canvas and place over the hole," shouted
up Obadiah Ironsides, who seemed to know just
what to do.  "I can fix it in position from down
here.  My ventilating pipes must have ripped
that hole.  Yes, I see now they are bent."
</p>

<p>
His voice held a note of genuine regret, which
every one on board the <i>Sea Ranger</i> was by far
too busy to notice, however.  Under Tom's
leadership, some spare sails, for use on the craft's
auxiliary masts, were hastily thrown over the
side.  The suction of the water drew them into
the hole, stopping it temporarily.  But the <i>Sea
Ranger</i> was low in the water, and it was plain
that she could not proceed on her voyage
without repairs being made.  These might prove to
be a lengthy operation.
</p>

<p>
Tom was almost in despair.
</p>

<p>
"For this accident to happen at this time above
all others!" he cried bitterly.
</p>

<p>
"I don't mind telling you," came Obadiah's
voice out of the darkness overside, "that if you
had kept on your course you'd have been
wrecked anyhow.  A big ridge of rocks lies
about a mile ahead of you.  How did you come
to be way off here out of the course of ships
going through the Straits?"
</p>

<p>
"We didn't know we were off our course,"
explained Tom.  "We were in pursuit of a band
of rascals.  Night overtook us, but we risked
keeping on, for it was urgent that we should
not get too far behind them."
</p>

<p>
"What's this?  What's this?" came Obadiah's
voice.  "My dear young man, I'm sorry indeed
that I was the cause of stopping you, although,
as I said, disaster must have overtaken you if
you had kept on."
</p>

<p>
"I suppose nothing is so bad that it mightn't
be worse," muttered Jeff.
</p>

<p>
"Tell you what," came Obadiah's voice
suddenly, "the town of Brownhaven, where I hail
from, isn't far from here.  You are not too
damaged to proceed under your own power, are
you?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't think so," rejoined Tom.
</p>

<p>
"Then this is my plan: I'll go ahead&mdash;on the
surface, of course&mdash;showing a light to guide
you.  You can follow along and before two
hours are over you'll be at a shipyard in
Brownhaven, where I can promise you quick repairs.
I'm safe in saying this, because I own the yard.
In fact, I erected it to build my submarines, of
which I hope to sell several to the government."
</p>

<p>
"It's a private yard, then?" said Tom.
</p>

<p>
"Yes; but, as the accident was my fault in a
way, I feel that it is only fair for me to do your
repairing free of charge."
</p>

<p>
"Good fo' yo', Mister Obadiah!" hailed the
voice of Rosewater, "and git us asho' as quick
as poss'bul, please, fo' ah is dyin' fo' a sight ob
dat dar terrier firma."
</p>

<p>
A few minutes later, with a light showing
from the submarine ahead, the crippled <i>Sea
Ranger</i> began to crawl slowly along.  It was a
pitiful travesty of her former brisk pace, and
Tom could almost have wept.  However, there
was really no one to blame, he felt, and this
Obadiah Ironsides, whoever he was, appeared to
be doing all he could to repair the mischief he
had unwittingly done.
</p>

<p>
In spite of the submarine man's promise, it
was considerably more than two hours before a
row of scattered lights, which Tom presumed
marked Brownhaven, came into view.  The
channel, too, was intricate, and altogether it was
well past midnight when the <i>Sea Ranger</i> was
anchored off a dry-dock, which Obadiah had
fitted up in his boat yard.
</p>

<p>
"Now," said he, coming alongside in his craft,
"if you fellows will come on board I'll take you
ashore.  I'll promise you that repair work will
be begun the first thing in the morning.  From
what I could see of the injury it ought not to
take more than a few hours."
</p>

<p>
The ship's company of the unfortunate <i>Sea
Ranger</i> descended, by means of a sea ladder, to
the submarine, whose outlines could only be seen
dimly.  As Tom's feet struck the deck plates of
the strange craft, they gave out a hollow,
metallic ring.
</p>

<p>
"Steel, with an aluminum alloy, which is my
secret," said the inventor.
</p>

<p>
"But come below, gentlemen; come below.
If this is your first visit to a submarine you may
find much to interest you."
</p>

<p>
He led the way to a sort of helmet-shaped
projection, pierced with eye-holes and screened
with very thick glass, which stood amidships.
He leaned down as he reached this, and pulled a
lever.  Instantly a door slid back with a clanging
sound, and a stream of soft light poured up
from below.  As it fell on Obadiah Ironsides'
face, Tom gave a cry of astonishment.  He had
not had a good view of the inventor before&mdash;the
light by which they had followed the submarine
not revealing his features fully.
</p>

<p>
Tom's exclamation, not in accord with true
politeness, was called forth by the fact that
Obadiah Ironsides, whose name and whose manner
both would have led one to suppose him an
aged man, was a mere youth.  In fact, he didn't
look much older than Tom.  He wore a suit of
some sort of black leather, like an automobilist's.
His hair curled crisply above a high, white
forehead, and his features, which were regular,
although strong and rugged, were lit up by a
pair of dancing blue eyes.
</p>

<p>
They danced more merrily than ever as he
gazed at Tom's astonished face and the amazed
looks of the rest of the "castaway crew."
</p>

<p>
"Thought Obadiah Ironsides was a regular
old fogy, eh?" he laughed, "Well, he's not.  Not
a bit of it.  But come below and see what you
think of my little craft."
</p>

<p>
So saying, he plunged into the opening in the
helmet-shaped conning tower, and was followed
by the others.  Inside the helmet was a steel
stairway by which they descended into
surroundings stranger than any of them had ever
encountered.

<h3>
CHAPTER XIII.
<br /><br />
THE STRANGEST VESSEL ON THE LAKES.
</h3>

<p>
The newcomers found themselves in a
cylindrical-shaped chamber, possibly twenty feet long
by twelve feet or so at its widest part.  The
rivet-studded walls showed that the structure
was of metal, but comfortable leather-covered
divans were placed along each side, inviting to
rest and meditation.  Obadiah Ironsides invited
his guests to sit on these while he explained his
craft.
</p>

<p>
After he had explained how it was driven by
gasoline engines on the surface, and by electrical
motors when under water, he conducted them
into the engine room.  Except for the electrical
driving machinery it did not differ radically from
that of the luckless <i>Sea Ranger</i>.  A striking
feature of the machinery, though, was the huge
pumps for exhausting the "sinking tanks" of
water when the operator of the craft wished to
rise, and the appliances for supplying fresh air
in quantities when submerged, by the expedient
of sucking out the exhausted atmosphere.
</p>

<p>
"How long could you keep submerged?" inquired Tom.
</p>

<p>
"For two days, if necessary.  I have accomplished
that already.  Possibly, at a pinch, that
time might be lengthened considerably," was the
response.
</p>

<p>
A visit to the forward compartment then
followed.  This was the space devoted to the
torpedo discharging machinery, for, as Obadiah had
explained, the primary purpose of the <i>Huron</i>
was for warfare.  And a formidable craft for
that purpose she appeared to be.  The interior of
the conning tower was next inspected.  It was
a place of mysterious levers, and wheels of glittering
brass and steel.  Like the rest of the craft
it was lighted by electricity.
</p>

<p>
On the walls were gauges to show submergence,
speed, air-pressure and several others,
which were far too technical in their purposes to
explain here.  A comfortable seat was provided
for the steersman, who could control the unique
steering apparatus by one hand by means of a
lever, or, in case of necessity, by pedals&mdash;like
those of an automobile.  This left his hands free
to attend to torpedo discharging and so on.
</p>

<p>
"In designing this craft," said Obadiah
Ironsides, "it has been my aim to provide a craft
that was of positively 'one-man control.'  It was
to try out how far this was feasible that I took
my lone trip under the lake to-night."
</p>

<p>
"And did you find your craft handled all
right?" inquired Tom.
</p>

<p>
"I did till I bumped your vessel on rising,"
said Obadiah Ironsides, with a whimsical
grimace.
</p>

<p>
"Is it not possible to provide some sort of
apparatus which will give you warning of the
vicinity of other craft?" asked the professor, who
had listened and observed with the deepest
attention while this singular hermit of the
underwater talked.
</p>

<p>
"It is," rejoined Mr. Ironsides; "in fact, I
have been experimenting with one which is in
readiness to be affixed to the <i>Huron</i>.  It is
similar in its workings to those used by Atlantic
liners in feeling their way through a fog."
</p>

<p>
"Then your submarine is complete?" asked Tom.
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  In two weeks' time I am going on a
trip through the great lakes with her, and then
I shall have her shipped to attend the government
tests at Newport News."
</p>

<p>
"One question more," put in the professor,
"you have chosen a very out-of-the-way place
to conduct your experiments."
</p>

<p>
"For a very obvious reason," said Obadiah
Ironsides, with one of his pleasant laughs, "you
must know that every navy in the world is
experimenting with submarines.  They are, in
conjunction with torpedo destroyers, the war vessel
of the future.  The Russo-Japanese war proved
that.  Now, then, the competition is naturally
keen among inventors to produce the best type
of submarine.  Inventors, as a class, are a splendid,
upright set of men; but, I regret to say, that
all are not so.  Some of them are unscrupulous
to a degree.  It was to escape the surveillance
of spies of a rival submarine concern that I
buried myself up here.  And there you have it,"
he concluded with a laugh, "unless, indeed, you
wish to know whence I get my funds?"
</p>

<p>
Tom and the professor held up their hands in
protest.
</p>

<p>
"My dear sir," said the professor.
</p>

<p>
"Not at all," laughed Obadiah.  "My father
was the well-known maker of iridium steel.  He
amassed a fortune in its manufacture.  I learned
my business in his foundry.  When he died he
left me his large fortune, which I devoted to
experimental work.  My dear mother soon
followed him to the grave, and then, having only
my work left to live for, I plunged into it with
a vengeance.  Possibly my ample funds have
helped me to go further than some inventors with
more ability but less capital," he concluded
modestly.  "So," he broke off with a laugh, "there
you have the autobiography of Obadiah Ironsides,
at your service.  And now, as it is late, and
I'm sure you are tired, we will retire."
</p>

<p>
"Have you a boat to get ashore?" asked Tom,
wondering when the resources of this wonderful
craft would be exhausted.
</p>

<p>
"I have one.  A water-tight craft bolted to
the deck.  She is reached by a trap in the ceiling
of this cabin.  But unless you insist upon going
ashore I'll show you that feature of the <i>Huron</i>
some other time.  But to my mind, the order of
the day&mdash;or, rather, night&mdash;is bed."
</p>

<p>
"Beds?" inquired Tom, looking about him as
if he rather expected to see some spring from
the floor of this wonderful craft.
</p>

<p>
The professor merely tried to look unamazed,
as became his dignity, while Jeff and Rosewater
were both frankly overcome and speechless by
the wonders they had beheld.
</p>

<p>
"I haven't advanced quite as far as that yet,"
laughed Obadiah, noting Tom's glance at the
floor, and reading it aright; "but those divans
can be converted into very comfortable Pullman
couches, and opposite the galley, which you
recollect is between the engine room and this
apartment, is a bathroom and shower, and all the
fittings just as you would find it in a hotel."
</p>

<p>
"Say, is there anything left out on this
wonderful craft?" gasped Tom in amazement.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, one thing," laughed Obadiah, "a
contract with Uncle Sam!"
</p>

<p>
Levers and springs controlled the couches,
which were reversible.  On the underside, as they
turned over, were discovered comfortable
mattresses, snowy sheets and neat counterpanes.
They lost no time in turning in, Tom having an
indistinct recollection of hearing Rosewater
murmur, as he sank off to sleep:
</p>

<p>
"Ef dis yar tea kittle sinks in de night ah
don' cahr.  Ah'se gwine ter sleep till dat Gabriel
blows his horn."
</p>

<p>
It was broad daylight when Tom awoke.  This
fact was evidenced by the sunlight streaming
cheerily through the open hatchway leading to
the deck.  An appetizing aroma of frizzling ham
and eggs, and the added savor of hot coffee,
filled the air.  It proceeded from the galley where
Obadiah had already set Rosewater to work.
</p>

<p>
Tom leaped up and made for the bathroom.
He reveled in the shower, and, having aroused
the professor and Jeff, he fell to his dressing
with a feeling of renewed vigor.  In daylight,
even inside this steel shell, things looked much
brighter than they had during the gloom and
uncertainty of the night.  He had hardly
completed his dressing when Obadiah himself
appeared, accompanied by an elderly man of
benign appearance.
</p>

<p>
"This is Sam Wrenchly, my foreman," he
explained.  "He has looked over the damage to the
<i>Sea Ranger</i> and informs me that it will take
two days to repair her."
</p>

<p>
"Two days!"
</p>

<p>
Tom could not repress a groan.  He sank
down on the edge of the bunk and buried his
head in his hands.  What might not happen to
his brother and his chum in two days?  It was a
crushing blow, and Tom could not be blamed for
feeling "knocked out" for an instant.
</p>

<p>
Obadiah placed a hand kindly on the lad's
shoulders.
</p>

<p>
"Come, cheer up, Tom," he said softly, "I have
news for you.  Sam here knows something of
this Captain Rangler and his haunts."
</p>

<p>
Tom looked up, alert in an instant.  The old
man nodded his head sagely, and smiled under
his gray beard.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Rangler and I met many years ago,"
he said; "but I have occasionally heard of him
since."
</p>

<p>
"And you think you know where he has taken
my brother Jack and my chum Sandy?" asked Tom.
</p>

<p>
"I think so," said the old man calmly.  "Did
you ever hear tell of Castle Rock Island?"
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap14"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIV.
<br /><br />
OFF ON A LONG CHASE.
</h3>

<p>
"Castle Rock Island!" echoed Tom, in an
amazed voice, "why&mdash;why&mdash;that's Mr. MacTavish's
island where we were going camping."
</p>

<p>
"Aye, it used to belong to a man named MacTavish,
a lumber capitalist from Mackinac.  It
may belong to him yet for all I know, but no
one's lived on it for many years, and it's become
a sort of roost for a gang of rascals," replied old
Sam Wrenchly.
</p>

<p>
"You are certain of this, Sam?" inquired Obadiah
Ironsides.
</p>

<p>
"As certain as I'm standing here," rejoined
the old man indignantly, as if he didn't much
like having his word questioned, "wasn't I
keeper of the old lighthouse that used to stand
there, and didn't I have trouble with this fellow
Rangler at that time?"
</p>

<p>
"So there used to be a lighthouse on it?" asked
Tom.
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  I guess the ruins of it are there yet.
But that channel isn't used any more, and the
lighthouse, if it's still there, must have fallen
into ruins.  Yes, it was a queer sort of place
was that island."
</p>

<p>
"Queer?  In what particular way?"
</p>

<p>
It was Obadiah Ironsides who put the question.
</p>

<p>
"Why, there were all sorts of tunnels and
places in it.  They say they were made by
Indians who formerly mined there for copper.
Some says as they're haunted by ghosts and
such.  But I place no stock in such stuff.  All I
know is that the tunnels is there.  I've seen
them with my own eyes.  One of them was right
close to the lighthouse.  Its mouth wasn't a
hundred yards from it.  The way I discovered
it was, my cow fell into it one day.  Aye, and
a fine job I had getting her out, too," quoth the
garrulous old man, "she was a strawberry-colored
cow, and as good a milker as ever&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Never mind that now, Sam," said Obadiah,
in his gentle but decisive way, "I think if you
will put the finishing touches on that submarine
device for detecting the location of nearby craft,
that it will be a good thing.  We may need it
as soon as possible."
</p>

<p>
The old man looked surprised, but made no comment.
</p>

<p>
"I'll get to work on it right off, sir," he said,
shuffling up the steel ladder, "all it needs is the
threads put on two bolts.  Wonder what's in the
wind now," he added to himself, as he clambered
laboriously up to the deck and then sculled
ashore by the boat with which he had come off
to the <i>Huron</i>.
</p>

<p>
At this juncture, the professor and Jeff
emerged from their ablutions and presently the
whole party was ready for breakfast.  Tom,
despite his worry, did ample justice to the meal.
The novel surroundings gave it an additional
zest.
</p>

<p>
When breakfast was concluded, Tom was for
going on deck at once, but Obadiah checked him.
</p>

<p>
The inventor and promoter of the <i>Huron</i>-type
of submarine had been in deep thought throughout
the repast.  Tom, and the rest with him,
concluded that his mind was busied with some
problem connected with his work.  But it now
proved that it had been otherwise.
</p>

<p>
With the suddenness, and yet thoroughness
characteristic of him, Obadiah Ironsides had
arrived at a decision which was to prove of great
moment to the Bungalow Boy and his friends.
</p>

<p>
"You wish to reach Castle Rock Island without
delay, of course, and discover if Rangler and
his rascally crew have really made it their
destination?" he said without preliminaries.
</p>

<p>
"Why of course," rejoined Tom, rather puzzled
as to what could be coming next, "anything
like a clew is worth investigating and&mdash;and this
seems to be a red hot one."
</p>

<p>
Obadiah Ironsides smiled slightly at the lad's
impetuous way of putting it.
</p>

<p>
"But how are you to get there till the <i>Sea
Ranger</i> is repaired?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"That's just it," muttered Tom disconsolately,
"Two days of delay, and who knows what may
happen in that time?  It's really mortifying.
But I suppose there's no help for it.  That is,
unless there is some fast craft we could charter
right here at Brownhaven."
</p>

<p>
"I think there is one," said Obadiah quietly.
</p>

<p>
"There is one?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"Where is it?  I'd like to&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The inventor held up a hand.  Tom had
started to his feet.
</p>

<p>
"No need to look very far for that craft," said
Obadiah smiling.
</p>

<p>
"I don't quite understand&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You are on board it."
</p>

<p>
"On board it?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  Right now.  The <i>Huron</i> is at your
disposal.  I feel that I was responsible for
delaying you at a critical moment.  All I can do
to repay you for the annoyance and anxiety is to
place myself and the <i>Huron</i> at your command.
No, don't thank me.  I have a selfish reason,
too.  Most of us have, I fancy, for our so-called
good actions.  I like to see rascals punished.
That's one reason for my aiding you in your
pursuit.  I wish to thoroughly try out the <i>Huron</i>
on a long cruise, that's another reason&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"And number three?" demanded Tom, whose
eyes were dancing with excitement and gratitude.
</p>

<p>
"Number three," quoth Obadiah heartily, "is
that I like you.  You're the right type of boy.
You know the old saying that 'Providence helps
those who help themselves.'  Well, in this case,
I'm going to play Providence."
</p>

<p>
"You and your fine craft," broke in the professor.
"Mr. Ironsides, you are a man in a thousand.
We can never be sufficiently grateful to you."
</p>

<p>
"No sah!  No sah!  No sah!  Dat we can't,
sah!" struck in Rosewater.
</p>

<p>
Crash!
</p>

<p>
In his enthusiasm the negro dropped an
armful of plates he had been removing.
</p>

<p>
The accident, and the negro's comical expression
of dismay, broke the tension of the moment,
which was becoming quite emotional.  They all
broke into a hearty laugh.
</p>

<p>
"I guess you can show your gratitude best by
not smashing the inventor's plates, you black
rascal," admonished Jeff, as Rosewater, quite
abashed, sought the seclusion of his galley.
</p>

<p>
"And now, come on deck," invited Mr. Ironsides,
"and take a look at the good craft <i>Huron</i>
in broad daylight."
</p>

<p>
They gladly obeyed the invitation.  On gaining
the deck, via the steel stairway, an animated
scene met their gaze.  All about spread the
sparkling waters of the harbor&mdash;a tiny place&mdash;with
the tree-enclosed town nestling on a hillside
at some little distance.  Close at hand lay the
poor <i>Sea Ranger</i>, a big, jagged hole showing in
her bow.  Ashore, almost opposite to them, was
the smokestack and high palings marking the
site of Mr. Ironsides' experimental ship yard,
where he fondly hoped the future submarines of
Uncle Sam's navy would be constructed.
</p>

<p>
On the foredeck of the <i>Huron</i> several men
had just completed straightening out the damage
done to the diving torpedo boat when she had
her accidental encounter with the <i>Sea Ranger</i>.
</p>

<p>
The deck was of whaleback shape, formed of
plates of the inventor's secret metal.  All round
were iron uprights, supporting a rail made of
steel chain.  Everything about the exterior of
the craft was painted a dull gray color&mdash;like that
of the sea on a cloudy day.  Mr. Ironsides
explained that this color made the craft almost
invisible, even when lying on the waves not more
than a mile from another vessel.  Not a bit of
bright work or brass was visible.  Nothing, in
fact, to catch a betraying ray of light.
</p>

<p>
Aft of the helmet-shaped conning tower, with
its two goggling eyes, and its smaller "optic" for
the projection of the rays of a powerful
searchlight, was a humpy-looking object, not unlike
the half of a giant gray watermelon.  This, the
inventor explained, was the <i>Huron's</i> "long boat."  It
provided an emergency means of leaving the
craft in case of accident.
</p>

<p>
It was bolted to the deck and hermetically
fastened by means of gaskets.  It was designed to
be entered from below by a trap door of metal
which could be instantly closed and sealed.  A
similar door was in the boat.  In case it was
desired to arise to the surface it was a simple
matter to crawl up into the boat, close the door in
the <i>Huron's</i> "skin," and then close a similar
contrivance in the deck of the singular long boat.
This rendered it practically a water-tight bottle
of steel.  To rise to the surface four bolts were
loosened when the "boat" would, of course,
detach itself from the <i>Huron</i> and shoot to the
surface.  This accomplished, those within could
unbolt the round plate by which they had entered,
and obtain air and a view of the surroundings.
To make this miniature submarine more complete,
a tiny gasolene motor of four horse power
was fitted inside it, enabling it to make about six
miles an hour on the surface.
</p>

<p>
There were many other features of the <i>Huron</i>,
to explain which, in detail, would be wearisome.
They may all be summed up by saying that not
a contrivance for safety or comfort appeared to
have been overlooked.  It would have been hard to
imagine a more completely outfitted craft for the
purposes for which she was designed.  Possibly
we should mention that she also carried a "field
wireless" apparatus, with an adjustable telescopic
steel pole to carry "the aerials."  This was
stored below, but when needed could be brought
on deck and communication established within a
radius of four hundred miles.  The generators
were, of course, operated by the machinery in
the hull below.
</p>

<p>
By the time all this, and much more, had been
explained by Mr. Ironsides, a boat appeared
from the shore, conveying old Sam Wrenchly,
who was to form one of the <i>Huron's</i> crew, and
his belongings.  The boys then took a trip to
the <i>Sea Ranger</i>, and selected what they wished
to carry along.  Necessarily, the outfits were
limited, so far as bulkiness was concerned.
</p>

<p>
Before the boat returned to the shore, Tom
composed, and entrusted to the workman who
rowed the boat back, a long telegram to Mr. Dacre.
This informed him minutely but concisely
of all that had occurred, and told him the
<i>Huron's</i> destination.  Tom took the liberty of
advising his uncle, should he decide to come
north, to take train to Brownhaven and proceed
to Castle Rock Island with the <i>Sea Ranger</i>,
which by that time would be repaired.  If all
went well they would await his coming there,
the message concluded.  Tom felt much relieved
when this had been done, and, with a lighter
heart than he had felt for some days, watched
with interest while the electrical winch hoisted
the <i>Huron's</i> anchor.
</p>

<p>
A few moments later, with Mr. Ironsides at
the wheel, the submarine nosed out of Brownhaven
Harbor.  She moved through the water
rapidly and with little vibration.
</p>

<p>
"Hurray!  We're off!" exclaimed Tom, who,
with the professor and Jeff, was seated on the
whaleback deck.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, off into the unknown," quoth the professor,
who was at times given to what he himself
would have called "hyperbole," and Tom,
"high faluting" language.
</p>

<p><a id="chap15"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XV.
<br /><br />
"WE'VE STRUCK A SUBMERGED WRECK!"
</h3>

<p>
It was one of the most fascinating experiences
that had ever befallen Tom Dacre&mdash;this of sitting
at his ease on the metal back of a submarine
monster, rushing through the water at a speed
which Mr. Ironsides declared was almost twenty-five
miles an hour.  The spray flew back in the
faces of the party on deck, whipping the keen
blood into their cheeks.  The roar of the water,
as the submarine parted it in two mighty
foam-crested waves, was like that of a waterfall.
</p>

<p>
"Better come inside now," said Mr. Ironsides,
after a while, "I'm going to try a burst of speed,
and you might get drenched."
</p>

<p>
When they were all assembled in the conning
tower, and pretty closely packed, too, they were,
in that narrow metal structure, Mr. Ironsides
pressed a button.  Far off somewhere within the
submarine, a faint tinkle responded.  It was a
bell calling on old Sam in the engine room to
"let her out."  Like a race horse when the
barrier flies up, the <i>Huron</i> gave a sudden leap
forward as her three propellers bit into the water.
A wave, like a tidal inundation, rose high on each
side of her bow.  From the conning tower she
appeared to be plowing her way through a
canyon whose walls were of water.
</p>

<p>
So suddenly had the burst of speed followed
the signal to increase her rate of progression,
that the party were thrown one against the other.
Tom almost lost his feet, fetching up against the
professor with a bump that caused the man of
science to ejaculate a most undignified "Ouch!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, what do you think of it?" inquired
Mr. Ironsides, who had stood calmly at his steering
lever with his lips compressed into a line, and his
hawk-like eyes peering keenly ahead during all
the confusion.
</p>

<p>
"Think!" exclaimed Tom, "I don't know what
to think.  It's&mdash;well&mdash;marvelous doesn't describe
it."
</p>

<p>
"So you are impressed, eh?" asked the inventor,
in whose tones an under current of satisfaction
was plainly perceptible.
</p>

<p>
"Impressed!  My dear sir, we are dumfounded!"
gasped the professor.
</p>

<p>
"Wait," went on the inventor with a queer
sort of smile, "you haven't seen half yet."
</p>

<p>
"What's coming now?" wondered Tom.  He
was about to speak, but instead a sudden cry
forced itself to his lips.  Looking down the
water-walled canyon through which they were
rushing he became all at once aware that the
huge black hull of a lake steamer was looming
right ahead of them.
</p>

<p>
At the terrific pace they were making (the
speed indicator recorded thirty knots), it seemed
impossible to avert disaster, swift, awful and in
evitable.
</p>

<p>
Tom glanced at the others.  The professor's
lips were parted with a look of horror.  Jeff was
white and was gripping a hand rail so tightly
that the blood had left his knuckles.  Rosewater
had turned a sickly gray under his black skin.
</p>

<p>
"Fo' de lan's sake!" he kept murmuring over
and over.
</p>

<p>
Then Tom's gaze was turned toward the
inventor.  He stood at his lever as immovable and
unmoved as a figure carved from stone.  A half
smile appeared frozen on his face.
</p>

<p>
They were very close to the black, wet sides of
the steamer now.  Tom, looking upward, could
see figures scurrying about her lofty decks.
They were gesticulating and pointing, and doubtless
shouting as they saw this little fury of the
lakes bearing down on them.  Even in that
thrilling moment Tom found himself wondering
how it would feel if the <i>Huron</i> was engaged in
war and the vessel they were rushing upon was
one of a fleet of Uncle Sam's enemies.
</p>

<p>
Try as he could to repress it, a shout would
force itself to his lips.  So close were they to
the steamer now, that one could plainly see the
rivets in her tall, black sides.  Tom even noted
her name, <i>North Star</i>.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Ironsides!" he cried, springing to the
inventor's side.
</p>

<p>
Had the man gone suddenly mad?  Did he
wish to hurtle them all into destruction?
</p>

<p>
The professor, too, sprang forward.
</p>

<p>
"Great heavens!" he cried, "we will be dashed
into eternity.  I implore!  I order!  I insist&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Swish-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h!
</p>

<p>
A strange sound suddenly filled Tom's ears.
The daylight was blotted out.  The lights flashed
up all through the diving boat.  The floor tilted
at a sharp angle, throwing the occupants of the
conning tower once more into a confused mass.
</p>

<p>
While they were still in a swirl of confusion,
the inventor's lean, claw-like hand shoved over
a lever.  The roaring noise ceased.  The <i>Huron</i>
resumed an even keel.
</p>

<p>
"We&mdash;we took a dive under that vessel?"
gasped Tom, in a voice of incredulity.
</p>

<p>
"We did," smiled Obadiah.  "You must forgive
me for scaring you, but sometimes I feel
like a schoolboy.  I love to play tricks.  I guess
you thought we were going to smash into that
ship's side."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I didn't see how it could be avoided,"
said Tom, rather shamefacedly, for the inventor's
eyes were fixed on him with a whimsical
smile.
</p>

<p>
"My dear sir!" expostulated the professor,
"I&mdash;we&mdash;of course, you must understand I was in
no sense alarmed&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Not any more than that time on the Omoo,
when poor Jack and Sandy played ghosts with
green faces," grinned Tom, sotto voce.
</p>

<p>
"Ah done heard dem golden harps playin' <i>jes'
as plain!</i>" confessed Rosewater frankly.
</p>

<p>
"Well, as you see, the <i>Huron</i> is under perfect
control at all times," said Mr. Ironsides.  "We
have dived under the keel of that craft, and I
imagine, caused those on board her to indulge
in a considerable amount of speculation as to
whether they really saw us or not."
</p>

<p>
He laughed in a care-free, boyish fashion that
he had, and which made it difficult for his
companions to realize that their shipmate was one
of the brainiest men in the United States.  They
had merely had a specimen of Mr. Ironsides'
way of amusing himself.
</p>

<p>
"Shall we come to the surface?" he asked
presently.
</p>

<p>
"I don't think it would be a bad idea," said
the professor, in a rather relieved tone, "this
darkness is&mdash;is&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"It kind of gets on one's nerves," said Tom,
finishing the sentence for him.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you'd soon get over that," said Mr. Ironsides
easily.  "Of course, it's natural, though.
I'll never forget the first time I went down in this
craft.  I was alone.  I didn't want any one else
to risk his life.  For a time I was in a state of
delightful uncertainty as to whether she'd rise
again or not."
</p>

<p>
"It must have been mighty unpleasant," volunteered Tom.
</p>

<p>
"It was, I can assure you.  But then I had the
pleasure of feeling that my boat had really dived,
whether or not she would come up again," said
Mr. Ironsides, in as matter-of-fact a tone as
could be imagined.
</p>

<p>
"Queer sort of pleasure," thought Tom, glancing
at the young inventor curiously.
</p>

<p>
"I think it's the&mdash;the loneliness under the
water that impresses one," he said aloud,
looking out of the conning tower window.  Ahead
lay a black void.  It was the same all about them.
The <i>Huron</i> was encompassed by solid walls of
water.  It was a weird, uncanny sensation, and
all of the party seemed to fall under its spell.
</p>

<p>
"Ready!" cried the inventor sharply, pulling
another lever.
</p>

<p>
It was as well he had uttered the warning, for
at that instant the prow of the <i>Huron</i> inclined
upward sharply.  The same swishing sound that
had filled the submarine when they sank made
itself noticed.
</p>

<p>
"It is the compressed air forcing the water out
of the submergence tanks," explained Mr. Ironsides.
"What you heard when we sank was the
noise of their being filled by an emergency
device, especially designed for a quick dive."
</p>

<p>
"Which, in that case, was necessary," remarked
Tom somewhat grimly.
</p>

<p>
All at once, while the submarine was still tilted
sharply on her upward course to the surface of
the lake, a bell above Mr. Ironsides' head tinkled
sharply.
</p>

<p>
Coming, as it did, in the midst of their acute
mental tension, it jangled Tom's nerves sharply.
</p>

<p>
"It's the sensograph!" exclaimed Mr. Ironsides,
with what Tom fancied was one sharp
flash of alarm.
</p>

<p>
"What does it mean?" began Tom.  "Are we&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"It means that we are in dangerous proximity
to a submerged wreck!" was the disquieting
reply.
</p>

<p>
The words had hardly left Mr. Ironsides' lips
before there was a jarring crash.
</p>

<p>
The submarine quivered throughout her structure.
Her swift motion ceased as if she had
been dealt a mortal blow.
</p>

<p>
As if he had been the victim of some ugly
nightmare, Tom felt the diving boat begin to
sink.  She seemed to be lying over on her
side&mdash;helpless beneath the waters of the lake.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap16"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVI.
<br /><br />
IN THE GRASP OF CALAMITY.
</h3>

<p>
Once before Tom had faced death in the
depths.  This was when he had battled with the
octopus in the wreck of a sunken treasure ship
in the tropic seas.  But then he had been fighting
for his uncle's life, and his success had been
dependent on his own efforts.
</p>

<p>
Imprisoned in the stricken submarine, however,
the experience was far different, and vastly
more alarming.  In the first place, none of them
could do anything but await the result of
Mr. Ironsides' hasty efforts to right his craft, and
the inaction was as hard to endure as the actual
peril.
</p>

<p>
From a speaking tube close to the helmsman's
ear a voice trickled up from the depths of the
diving vessel's interior.  It was old Sam calling
up from the engine room.
</p>

<p>
"What's happened, sir?"
</p>

<p>
Tom could hear the words as plainly as one
can sometimes hear a voice coming over the
phone even when one is at some distance from
the receiver.
</p>

<p>
"We've struck something, Sam.  I don't know
what yet," shouted back the inventor, in a steady,
even tone.  "Better stand right by your engines.
Are they working all right?"
</p>

<p>
"Splendidly, sir," came back the response.
"Any other orders, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"No, that's all for the present, Sam."
</p>

<p>
Tom felt ashamed of himself.  With this feeling
came a new one of self-possession, taking
the place of the deadly, almost nauseating fear
he had experienced an instant before.  If the
inventor and his assistant could be calm, so could
he, Tom Dacre, master his terror.
</p>

<p>
He stepped up to Mr. Ironsides, making his
way with some difficulty, for the submarine was
still wallowing over on her side.  But, in
obedience to Mr. Ironsides' previously telegraphed
orders, she was backing slowly away from the
hidden obstruction she had collided with.
</p>

<p>
"Any orders, Mr. Ironsides?"
</p>

<p>
The inventor glanced round.  His face was
lined and rigid, but he showed no trace of his
deep anxiety other than this.  For all the
excitement he betrayed, he might have had ice water
instead of blood in his veins.
</p>

<p>
"Ah!  It's you, Tom Dacre?  Yes, I have
some orders.  I wish you would go forward into
the torpedo chamber and see if we are taking in
any water.  I'm rather afraid that a plate may
have been sprung."
</p>

<p>
"And if there is a leak?" asked the professor,
who, like Tom, had succeeded in mastering
his first alarm.
</p>

<p>
"If there is," was the placid response, "we
must stop it; or," he paused for an instant, "or
remain down here."
</p>

<p>
Even Tom blanched anew at these words.
Death in a watery tomb was staring them in the
face.  But he hastened off on his errand.
Anything was better than helpless inaction at such a
moment.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately, the lights had not been extinguished
in the crash, and the metal-walled torpedo
room was illuminated brilliantly with a flood
of electric light.  To his great relief, Tom, after
a careful examination, was able to report that
there were no apparent injuries to the <i>Huron</i>,
forward.  She seemed to be as tight as a bottle,
thanks, doubtless, to her double "skin."
</p>

<p>
"I hardly thought that she would be seriously
damaged," said the inventor calmly.  "See, she
is coming up on an even keel, too, now.  I guess
we'll start a little investigation right here."
</p>

<p>
"Ain't we a-gwine up to de top?" whined Rosewater,
who was cowering in a corner.
</p>

<p>
"Not yet," was the calm response, "I want to
find out just what it was we struck."
</p>

<p>
"Good heavens!  The man must be made of
his own metal," Tom heard the professor gasp
under his breath.  But, excepting Rosewater,
none of them remonstrated.
</p>

<p>
While they watched him curiously, Mr. Ironsides
shoved the engine room signal lever over
to "Ahead, slow."
</p>

<p>
The backward motion of the diving craft
ceased.  She began to creep forward.
</p>

<p>
All at once, Mr. Ironsides pressed a button at
his elbow.  A sharp click responded, and the
water in front of the <i>Huron</i> became illuminated
with a flood of brilliant, blinding white light.
Tom could see fish dart off out of the lane of
light like coveys of partridges.  Some, fascinated
seemingly by the rays, flocked about the conning
tower, dashing themselves against its thick
lenses like moths round a lamp chimney.
</p>

<p>
"That searchlight is the most powerful I could
devise," said Mr. Ironsides, in a tone of quiet
satisfaction.  "I guess it's doing its work all
right."
</p>

<p>
"I guess so," agreed Tom enthusiastically.
The boy had quite forgotten his alarm in the
sensation of watching the wonderful illumination
of the waters.
</p>

<p>
"Keep a sharp lookout," urged the inventor.
"I am anxious to see what it was that we
struck."
</p>

<p>
Tom found himself wondering over the necessity
for this, but he held his peace, and busied
himself in gazing out of the conning tower
windows.  For some time nothing appeared in the
field of light but masses of water.  The liquid
looked greenish and almost solid&mdash;like thick
glass&mdash;in the powerful rays of the searchlight.
</p>

<p>
"It must be somewhere hereabout," commented
Mr. Ironsides, after several minutes had gone
by without revealing anything.
</p>

<p>
He began to move the searchlight about,
controlling its shiftings by a worm-gear and wheel.
</p>

<p>
All at once Tom spied something, a dark,
indefinite-looking mass, off to the right.
</p>

<p>
"Look!  Look there, Mr. Ironsides!" he cried.
</p>

<p>
"Jove, boy, you have sharp eyes!" commented
the inventor, turning his gaze in the direction
Tom had indicated.
</p>

<p>
"Is that what we struck, sir, do you think?"
asked the boy.
</p>

<p>
"We'll go closer and see what it is.  Oh, don't
be afraid, professor; there's no danger this
time," he added, for the man of science had
begun to protest against what he termed "sheer
recklessness."
</p>

<p>
Slowly, very slowly, the <i>Huron</i> crawled
through the lower waters.
</p>

<p>
It speedily became evident that the indefinite
object that Tom had seen, looming up vast and
shadow-like in the searchlight's path, was the
sunken wreck of some sort of a vessel.  As they
drew closer, they could make out the masts and
see the big black hull.
</p>

<p>
"Humph!" commented Mr. Ironsides.  "It's
lucky the sensograph gave warning when it did,
or we might not be in as good shape as we are
now."
</p>

<p>
Under the inventor's handling, the <i>Huron</i> was
moved slowly round the sunken craft.  She had
been lumber laden, evidently, for part of her
cargo could be seen still lashed to her decks.
</p>

<p>
As they rounded her stern, Tom saw a name
in white paint inscribed on it.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Mary J. Jennings</i>&mdash;Rockport."
</p>

<p>
"Why, I recall reading about the loss of the
<i>Jennings</i>!" he cried.  "It was last winter, in a
bitter storm, that she was lost with all hands.
At least, they supposed she was lost, for she
never reappeared.  I suppose her load of lumber
had kept her from sinking altogether, though
she was water-logged enough to be submerged."
</p>

<p>
"I guess that's it," agreed the inventor.  "That
craft," he went on solemnly, "is the grave of a
crew of brave men."
</p>

<p>
"And might have proved the cause of our
being doomed to a tomb on the bottom of the
lake," struck in Tom.  He shook his fist at the
sodden wreck as the searchlight illumined her
outlines.
</p>

<p>
The inventor turned to him with a smile.
</p>

<p>
"Makes you feel mad, doesn't it, Tom?" he
asked.
</p>

<p>
"Well, not mad, exactly.  I hardly know how
to describe it," faltered Tom.
</p>

<p>
"How would you like to have revenge on her,
to put her out of the way for good?" asked the
inventor.
</p>

<p>
"How do you mean?" asked the lad, rather
incredulously.
</p>

<p>
"I mean that if she should ever come to the
surface she is a real menace to navigation.  As
it is, she almost caused the loss of the <i>Huron</i>.
I should like to remove her forever."
</p>

<p>
An inkling of his meaning dawned on Tom.
</p>

<p>
"You mean that you want to torpedo her?"
he demanded.
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  It would give me a whole lot of
satisfaction.  What do you say?"
</p>

<p>
"That would certainly be a revenge of a twentieth
century character," spoke the professor.
</p>

<p>
"By George!" exclaimed the inventor, with
more animation than he had shown since our
party had encountered him, "we'll do it.  Here,
Jeff, you take the wheel.  Keep her circling
round the wreck.  Tom Dacre, I've a job for you
in the torpedo room."
</p>

<p>
"A job for me?" echoed Tom wonderingly.
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  You are appointed assistant annihilator
of the submarine <i>Huron</i>."
</p>

<p><a id="chap17"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVII.
<br /><br />
CAPTAIN RANGLER RE-APPEARS.
</h3>

<p>
Leaving Jeff at the wheel, with strict orders
not to meddle with anything, the inventor
preceded Tom into the torpedo room.  He produced
a bunch of keys and unlocked a metal closet, high
up on one wall of the place.  From this he
produced a globe, about ten inches in diameter and
a dull black in color.
</p>

<p>
From the top of it a small key projected.
While Tom watched with fascinated interest,
the inventor went into the extreme forward part
of the torpedo room, which, of course, was right
up in the bow of the <i>Huron</i>.
</p>

<p>
A cylindrical tube&mdash;not unlike the breech of a
rapid fire gun&mdash;projected into the place, and the
inventor rapidly adjusted several small wheels
and valves.  Then he opened the rear of the tube
and motioned to Tom.
</p>

<p>
"We're about ready now," he said.  "You
might bring that torpedo from the rack."
</p>

<p>
He indicated a cage-like basket, in which he
had placed the metal globe after taking it from
the closet.
</p>

<p>
"The torpedo?" said Tom, looking about him.
</p>

<p>
Not unnaturally the boy was looking for one
of the cylindrical, cigar-shaped implements of
war, which he had always associated with the
word "torpedo."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Ironsides smiled slightly.
</p>

<p>
"I mean that metal globe," he said.
</p>

<p>
"What!  Is that a torpedo?" demanded Tom
incredulously.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, and one twenty times more powerful
than the Whitehead type in use in our navy
to-day."
</p>

<p>
"But it looks more like a bomb than a torpedo.
Where is its driving machinery?  How
does it go through the water?"
</p>

<p>
"You'll see all that in a minute.  For many
reasons, the ordinary type of torpedo is not much
used for submarine work.  So I had to go to work
and think out a torpedo of novel design as well
as a boat.  That globe is the result.  Thank you,"
as Tom handed it to him, using every precaution
against dropping it, as you may be sure.
</p>

<p>
"Now, then," said Mr. Ironsides, drawing a
brass tube out of the breech of the firing cylinder,
"you see, I put this globe in this tube&mdash;this
way."
</p>

<p>
As he spoke, he thrust the metal globe into the
brass tube, which it fitted snugly.  The key-like
projection remained sticking out of the end of
the tube, however.
</p>

<p>
"If the <i>Huron</i> was used for surface work,"
went on Mr. Ironsides, "she could, if her officers
wished, handle and fire ordinary torpedoes.  But
to overcome the pressure at this depth, terrific
driving force is necessary.  To furnish this, I
use compressed air superheated, coupled with
an explosive gas, generated in the muzzle of the
torpedo tube as the bomb passes through.  Do
you follow me?"
</p>

<p>
It is doubtful if Tom did.  But, at all events,
he grasped the main idea of the inventor's
discourse.
</p>

<p>
"Now, then," went on Mr. Ironsides, "I am
going to start the mechanism which combines the
two elements contained in this globe into a
death-dealing combination."
</p>

<p>
He twisted the key, and a clicking sound
resulted like that which emanates from a
mechanical toy when it is being wound up.
</p>

<p>
"We're all ready now," he declared finally.
"The only thing left to do is to 'ram home,' as
they say in the navy."
</p>

<p>
So saying, the inventor thrust the brass tube,
containing the projectile, into the breech of the
firing tube, in much the same manner as the
brass cartridge is thrust into the breech of a
naval gun.
</p>

<p>
Then he closed the breech and locked its
mechanism with a sharp snap.
</p>

<p>
"Now, Tom Dacre, boy," he exclaimed, an
exulting note in his voice, "we are ready for
our up-to-date act of justice on yonder sunken
wreck."
</p>

<p>
Tom caught the infection of his enthusiasm.
</p>

<p>
"In a few moments she will be blown to bits?"
he questioned, marveling even while he spoke.
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  If all goes well, that schooner will have
ceased to exist at precisely," the inventor drew
out his watch, "in precisely four minutes.  I'm
going to the conning tower.  The firing lever
and appliances are there.  Do you wish to
accompany me, or will you remain here?"
</p>

<p>
"I guess I'll go with you," rejoined Tom.
</p>

<p>
"Then hurry.  It would be awkward if those
gases in the bomb became uncontrollable before
we had fired it from the <i>Huron's</i> side."
</p>

<p>
They found Jeff at the wheel, slowly circling
the water-logged wreck, according to instructions.
Tom glanced at the bulk of the half-sunken
schooner with a kind of pity.  In his
mind she was dissolved into fragments already.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Ironsides, without a trace of haste in his
manner, took the wheel from the Trulliber lad.
He so manipulated the submarine that, within a
few moments, she was at some distance from the
sunken wreck, hovering like a hawk that is about
to strike.  Tom hastily described to the others his
experiences in the torpedo room.
</p>

<p>
They listened with keen interest.  Their
discussion of what was to come was broken in
upon by the inventor's voice.
</p>

<p>
"I guess we are about ready now," he said.
</p>

<p>
Tom fixed his gaze on the man.  He stood at
the wheel motionless.  Without a very keen
imagination it was easy to picture him as a kind
of fate about to hurtle a deadly thunderbolt.
</p>

<p>
"Now!"
</p>

<p>
The word came suddenly, and was followed
by an almost imperceptible movement of the
inventor's hand to a polished quadrant.  A lever
moved swiftly across the shining sector.
</p>

<p>
Almost instantly a shock made the submarine
quiver.  Tom knew that the tremendous forces
that were to drive the bomb through the water
had been released.
</p>

<p>
"Watch the wreck, please.  If all goes well,
you'll see something worth watching."
</p>

<p>
It was Mr. Ironsides speaking again.  The
faces of the visitors to the submarine were
speedily glued against the observation lenses.
</p>

<p>
Tom saw a white streak cut through the water,
leaving a train of bubbles in its wake.  Then
came a jar, and he felt a queer sensation on his
ear drums, but that was all.  All except that
right ahead of them the black bulk of the wreck
seemed suddenly to dissolve into nothingness.  It
had been and&mdash;was not!
</p>

<p>
Obadiah Ironsides' twentieth century revenge
on the object that had so nearly caused disaster
to his wonderful diving craft was complete.
</p>

<p>
"It's like magic!" gasped Tom, hardly able to
believe that the solid timbers had been entirely
obliterated before his very eyes.
</p>

<p>
"It is magic," breathed the professor.
</p>

<p>
"Now, I think we may as well arise and note
the effects of our shot," said Mr. Ironsides, in
his usual matter-of-fact voice.  Now that the
shot had been fired, and had been successful, the
slight flush of anxiety on his pale face had
vanished, leaving it as icicle-like as ever.
</p>

<p>
Up they shot, at what seemed lightning speed.
</p>

<p>
They were on the surface almost before they
realized it.  The welcome light shone in through
the conning tower lenses, and the sunlight
sparkled on the dripping back of Mr. Ironsides'
strange sea monster.
</p>

<p>
"Let us open the conning tower hatch and go
out on deck," suggested the inventor, after
notifying old Sam in the engine room to switch his
power from the electrical motors to gasolene.
</p>

<p>
They were nothing loath to do so.  Although
the time had seemed short, they had been below
the surface for some hours, and the air was
beginning to feel stuffy.
</p>

<p>
Tom inhaled with delight the fresh atmosphere,
and the cool breeze that swept over the
lake.  He took it in by great lungfulls.  The
others did the same.
</p>

<p>
A glance about at the surface of the water
showed the terrible havoc the bomb had wrought
on the submerged wreck.  The surface of the
lake in their vicinity was strewn with beams and
bits of timber.  The wreck had literally been
blown into a thousand pieces.
</p>

<p>
All at once, Tom's attention was caught by
something close at hand.  At first he thought it
was an ordinary bit of wreckage.  He leaned
over the chain-rail the better to view it.
Suddenly, however, he recoiled with a cry of
horror.  The object, lazily bobbing on the surface,
had suddenly turned upward.
</p>

<p>
Then Tom saw that what had attracted his
attention was the body of a man, undoubtedly
one of the unfortunates who had been caught
below decks when the schooner sank.  And now
the bomb had set him free from his tomb.
</p>

<p>
Even as Tom's horrified gaze rested for an
instant on the grisly object, it vanished, leaving
a widening circle of wavelets about it.
Instinctively, Tom bared his head.
</p>

<p>
"I am saying farewell to a brave man," he
said, as the others hastened to his side to inquire
the reason of his sudden cry.
</p>

<p>
As there was no reason for lingering in the
vicinity, the <i>Huron</i>, soon after, was put under
full speed, and under her powerful engines she
passed through the straits before sundown.
</p>

<p>
Supper was eaten, and Tom once more
emerged on deck before the after-glow had
faded.  He gazed about him abstractedly.  The
lad was sorely troubled.  Now that the excitement
of the novel trip on the submarine had
worn off, thoughts of his brother's plight and of
Sandy's misfortune came back to him with
redoubled force.
</p>

<p>
All at once&mdash;to the westward&mdash;a dark cloud
appeared against the glowing sky.
</p>

<p>
"Smoke!" decided Tom.  "Some craft coming
this way."
</p>

<p>
For half an hour or more he watched till the
outlines of a tug appeared from the direction
in which he had first noticed the column of
vapor.
</p>

<p>
Tom watched her without especial interest
for a time, and then the blood began rushing
through his pulses in leaps and bounds.  He
bounded to his feet and rushed to the conning
tower.  Thrusting his head over the hatchway,
he gave a shout that electrified those below.
</p>

<p>
"Captain Rangler's tug is dead ahead and
coming toward us!" he announced.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVIII.
<br /><br />
A MAN OF QUEER MANNERS.
</h3>

<p>
At just about the same moment that the
submarine encountered the sunken wreck, Jack
Dacre, as well as Sandy MacTavish, was sucked
into the black and treacherous slime of the
slough.  As our readers will recall, we left both
lads in about as bad a situation as could be
imagined.
</p>

<p>
Jack's cries were beginning to grow feeble,
when aid appeared from an unsuspected
quarter.  From the margin of woods surrounding
the swamp, there suddenly emerged the figure
of a rough-looking man.  He carried a gun and
was accompanied by two savage looking dogs.
</p>

<p>
"Hullo!  What's the trouble here?" he demanded
in an amazed voice, as his gaze lighted
on the two struggling lads.  By this time the
marsh had engulfed Sandy to the arm-pits.  Jack
was in almost as bad a fix.
</p>

<p>
"For goodness' sake, help us out of this,"
implored Jack.  "We can't hold out much longer."
</p>

<p>
The man grunted, but seemed in no hurry to
aid them.
</p>

<p>
"You must be a fine pair of young fools," was
his comment.  "Any one could see that there was
quicksands in thar'."
</p>

<p>
"Who are you, and how did you come here?"
he demanded roughly the next minute.
</p>

<p>
"We'll tell you all that when you get us out of
this," ejaculated Sandy.  "Mon! mon, will ye
stand glowerin' there, while we are sinking
deeper all the time?"
</p>

<p>
"Serves you right for blundering in there,"
was the astonishingly heartless response.
</p>

<p>
The man turned away, whistling to his two
dogs, and vanished in the woods.  But, after all,
the action was not as cold-blooded as it appeared.
Instead of leaving the two lads to their fate, as
it first had appeared, the man presently returned
with some sticks of young timber.
</p>

<p>
He thrust these toward the two immersed lads,
grumbling, the while, savagely to himself.
Neither Jack nor Sandy was, fortunately, too
weak to take advantage of this grudging aid.  It
was well that this was so, for the man didn't
appear anxious to help them further.  But when
both lads had caught on to the sticks, with a firm
hold he did bestir himself to pull and tug, and
soon, what with their own struggles and the
man's efforts, the two lads were out of the marsh.
They were pitiful objects, indeed, as they stood
on its marge.  Black mud clung to them, like a
sort of sticky paste.  Their faces were strained
and white.  Perspiration poured in rivulets
down them.  Besides, they were shaky and
unnerved from their ordeal.
</p>

<p>
But their appearance in no wise seemed to
move the pity of the man.  He laughed grimly
as his two dogs flew furiously at the two newly
rescued lads.
</p>

<p>
"Lucky for you that them dogs didn't come
on you when I wasn't by," he said, filling and
lighting a short pipe, and seating himself on a
log.  "They'd have torn you limb from limb.
Now, then," he demanded, with a sudden accession
of fierceness, "who are you, anyhow?  What
are you doing on Castle Rock Island?"
</p>

<p>
"We've escaped&mdash;&mdash;" began Sandy, when
something warned him that it would be as well
to disguise the true state of affairs from this
gruff, unsympathetic sort of individual.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, ho!  You've escaped, have you?" said the
man, with an ugly leer.  "And from what, pray?"
</p>

<p>
"From our boat.  It was wrecked," volunteered
Jack, with a sufficient statement of facts
to cover the case.  "But is this Castle Rock
Island, really?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course, it is.  Didn't I say so?"
</p>

<p>
Jack and Sandy exchanged astonished glances.
So they had reached their destination, after all.
But in what an astonishing way!
</p>

<p>
"Well," glowered the man, "is that all?"
</p>

<p>
"I guess so," responded Jack, "except that we
fell into the marsh while looking for a place
where we could get some food and rest.  We've
got money to pay for it," he added, thinking that
the man might live nearby.
</p>

<p>
The fellow's eyes lit up at the mention of
money.
</p>

<p>
"How much you got?" he questioned.
</p>

<p>
Jack displayed a roll of bills of comfortable
proportions, for, as we know, the rascals on the
tug had not thought it worth while to search
their young prisoners.
</p>

<p>
The man's eyes dwelt on the money as if in
speculation.  He remained silent for a few
seconds.  Then he spoke in his gruff way.
</p>

<p>
"Come with me," he said, rising to his feet.
</p>

<p>
"Do you think he is all right?" whispered
Sandy, as they prepared to follow.
</p>

<p>
"Frankly, I don't.  But we must trust to luck.
We've got to get something to eat, and I imagine
he is some sort of a woodsman.  He may have a
good heart, even if his manners are gruff."
</p>

<p>
"A-weel," sighed Sandy, "I don't trust him a
bit more than you do.  But we maun find some
place to rest, I'm thinking."
</p>

<p>
So they plunged into the woods after the man,
who was looking back at them interrogatively.
He strode along at some distance ahead.  Ever
and anon he would glance back to see if they
were following.  But he didn't speak.
</p>

<p>
They must have progressed thus for half an
hour or more, when they suddenly emerged upon
the shore from the trail they had hitherto been
following.  Before them spread the waters of
the lake in all their vast solitude.  Behind them
lay the forest, and to their right towered a great
mass of rocks and craggy cliffs, that were wild
and primeval looking.  But it was none of these
things that transfixed the gaze of the two lads,
and, tired as they were, filled their eyes with
eager interest.
</p>

<p>
What captured their attention, to the exclusion
of every other feature of the landscape, was
a tower of rough outline, about forty feet or more
in height, which stood directly in front of them
on a little rocky promontory.
</p>

<p>
It was built of stone, which had, apparently,
been taken from the cliffs adjoining.  A rough
flight of steps, also of stone, encircled it outside,
reaching to the summit.  The ruins of what had
once been a light-house lantern on the top
proclaimed the uses to which the tower had been
put before it fell into ruin.  About its base
creepers grew luxuriantly; but they had been
cleared away at one point, where a door, heavily
studded with iron rivets, was observable.
</p>

<p>
"Do you live here?" inquired Jack, as the man
walked up to the door with the confident air of
possession.
</p>

<p>
"I do&mdash;yes.  If you want anything to eat, you
had better come inside."
</p>

<p>
Such was the gruff rejoinder of the man, as
he inserted a key in the door and swung it open.
Evidently, the outside stairs were not used by
him.  A closer view, in fact, showed that they
were tottering, like the rest of the structure,
and probably were not safe.
</p>

<p>
Sandy and Jack exchanged swift glances, as
the man undid the door.  Was this some trap
that they were being enticed into?  But, hungry
and faint as they were, the lads were not in a
critical mood.  While they still hesitated, the
man turned round.
</p>

<p>
"Well," he said grumpily, "are you comin' in,
or ain't you?  I can't wait here all night."
</p>

<p>
"We'll be right with you," said Jack with
alacrity, stepping forward and resolutely
putting his fears behind him, "I hope dinner's
ready," he added by way of a small pleasantry.
</p>

<p>
But in return for his smiling remark, the man
only mumbled something, and whistled to his
dogs.  Then, followed by the two lads, he
entered the ancient door, which groaned on its
hinges, with what Jack's excited mind
interpreted as a note of warning.  But it was too
late to turn back now.
</p>

<p>
As the man swung the door to behind them
and locked it, Jack felt that they were committed
to the adventure, come what might.
</p>

<p><a id="chap19"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIX.
<br /><br />
WITHIN THE TOWER.
</h3>

<p>
Inside they found themselves in a circular
room.  The floor was bare, but fairly clean.
Facing the door was a rusty stove, with an iron
pot and a kettle smoking and steaming on it, in a
way that gave promise of a speedy meal.  For
the rest, there was a rough table and several
chairs set about in disorder.  In one corner was
a tall cupboard.
</p>

<p>
Their host approached this receptacle after
he had set down his gun, and produced three tin
cups, three tin plates and the accompanying
knives and forks.  Likewise, he set out bread,
and salt and pepper casters.  This done, he took
off the pot from the stove, and with a ladle,
dished out upon each dish a fairly generous
portion of a kind of stew.
</p>

<p>
"There's water in that bucket in the corner,"
he volunteered, sitting down and beginning to
shovel in his food with scant courtesy.
</p>

<p>
The lads filled their tin cups at the receptacle
mentioned, and then fell to on the food, with
what appetites may be imagined.  Whatever
their hardships had been, they had not interfered
with their abilities as trenchermen.
</p>

<p>
While they ate, the man eyed them curiously,
but he said nothing.  In fact, once or twice, when
Jack looked up and caught the fellow furtively
eying them, the other looked hastily away, as if
he had been caught in some mean act.  In this
manner the meal was eaten, and when it had
been despatched the man spoke.
</p>

<p>
"You said something about paying," he
grunted in his mumbling tones.
</p>

<p>
"Certainly," rejoined Jack; "how much do we
owe you?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, now, considering that I have to use
powder and shot for everything I get, and that
you two lads have made a terrible hole in my
larder, I don't think a dollar apiece is too much."
</p>

<p>
The man looked up, as if he half-expected
the lads to refuse to pay this exorbitant sum.
But Jack readily paid him, only remarking that
they felt so much better that he would willingly
have paid even more.
</p>

<p>
"And noo," began Sandy, "the question arises,
what comes next?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, how are we to reach some point where
we can communicate with our friends?" asked
Jack.
</p>

<p>
The man hesitated.  Then, as if an idea had
suddenly occurred to him, he spoke:
</p>

<p>
"There's a small steamer that rounds the
islands regularly.  She'll touch in here this
evening.  Tell you what you do&mdash;give me another
dollar each, and I'll let you sleep upstairs in a
room I have till it's time for you to catch the
boat."
</p>

<p>
This answer seemed straightforward enough.
At all events, Jack and Sandy felt so sleepy
after their meal that they were ready to accept
it without much hesitancy.  Two more dollars
were passed over, and then the man conducted
them to a stairway at one side of the room.  He
mounted it, mumbling to himself all the while;
but by this time the lads had come to the conclusion
that the fellow was a sort of harmless
eccentric, and did not pay much attention to his
manner.
</p>

<p>
Up and up they climbed, circling the tower
several times, it seemed, till they arrived at a
small door opening off the staircase.  The man
opened this, and showed them into a room.  It
contained a rough bed and some scanty furniture.
It had one window high up in the wall&mdash;too
high for the lads to see out; but it was
well-lighted and ventilated&mdash;the latter for the
excellent reason that the window was always open.
It was not glazed.
</p>

<p>
"There, I reckon you can make out there, all
right," said the man.
</p>

<p>
As he prepared to leave the room, Jack
reminded him of his promise to awaken them in
time for the inter-island boat, in case they
overslept.
</p>

<p>
"Don't worry," said the man, with more of a
friendly air than he had yet assumed, "I'll take
good care of you."
</p>

<p>
There was a sinister intonation in the way
that he said this last which did not escape Jack's
quick ear.  But it was too late to worry now.  If
the man meant them harm, they were fairly in
his power; and the only thing to do was not to
let him see that they suspected him.
</p>

<p>
Removing their shoes, coats and waistcoats,
the lads flung themselves down on the bed.
Sandy, after mumbling a few sleepy comments
on the strange place in which they found
themselves, dropped off into profound slumber.  Jack,
in a pleasant sort of half-waking, half-sleeping
doze, remained alert some minutes longer.
</p>

<p>
It was just as he was dropping off to sleep
in good earnest that he thought he heard a
queer noise at the door.
</p>

<p>
"It sounds as if some one had locked it on
the outside," he muttered drowsily.
</p>

<p>
He started to arouse himself to investigate;
but in the very act of summoning his drowsy
faculties the boy's weariness overcame him.  His
tired limbs mutinied, his eyes closed, and he was
off to dreamland as soundly as Sandy.
</p>

<p>
Hardly had he dozed off, when from the
woods through which their guide had conducted
them a short time before, Walstein and Dampier
and two of the crew of the tug emerged.
They had left Rangler in charge of the craft,
with instructions to cruise in the vicinity and see
if he could make out any trace of the fugitives.
They themselves had made for the abandoned
light-house to organize a thorough search of the
island.
</p>

<p>
As they drew near to the light, the man who
had entertained Jack and Sandy emerged from
the door.
</p>

<p>
"Hullo, there, Bill Barkentin," hailed
Walstein.  "What's the news?"
</p>

<p>
"What's yours?" grumbled the man ungraciously,
in much the same manner he had
addressed the boys.
</p>

<p>
"The same old bear," laughed Dampier.  "How
is our prisoner getting along?"
</p>

<p>
"He's as obstinate as ever," was the grumbled
reply.  "Won't tell a thing about the
government's plans in regard to us."
</p>

<p>
"You've still got him on close diet?" asked
Walstein.
</p>

<p>
"Have I?  Should say so.  He's getting as
thin as a rail; but he's just as obstinate as an
old army mule.  Won't tell nothing."
</p>

<p>
"Humph!  Well, he'll talk after awhile.  By
the way, we'll have two other prisoners to join
him before long."
</p>

<p>
"How's that?" grunted Bill Barkentin, without
betraying any special interest.
</p>

<p>
"Why, two boys whom we were holding for
ransom have escaped," rejoined Walstein.
"They fled from the tug, and are now on this
island some place.  You know the island better
than any one else.  When we've had something
to eat you had better guide us all over it on a
thorough search."
</p>

<p>
"No need to search," grunted Bill Barkentin
as imperturbably as if what he had just heard
was not news to him.
</p>

<p>
"How's that, Bill?" asked Dampier, in a sort
of mocking voice.  It was plain that he despised
this taciturn old keeper of the rascals' rendezvous.
</p>

<p>
"'Cos they're here now," announced Bill,
replenishing his pipe, which had gone out.
</p>

<p>
"What!" exclaimed Dampier.  "Do you mean
to say, you old barnacle, that you've actually got
those two lads in the tower?"
</p>

<p>
"Yep.  They're tucked in their little bed at
this very minute.  I found 'em stuck in a marsh
about four miles from here.  As they had some
money, I brought 'em here.  I thought that after
they got to sleep I'd get what coin they had and
then turn them loose.  But now I see things is
different.  They are your game, eh?"
</p>

<p>
"Never mind about the money, Bill," said
Dampier, whose sallow face was beaming with
ferocious delight; "the money they have is yours,
Bill&mdash;all yours.  Oh, what a stroke of luck, eh,
Walstein?"
</p>

<p>
"I should say so," assented the leonine-headed
ruffian.  "Have you got them locked in, Bill?"
</p>

<p>
"We-el, you know Bill Barkentin," grinned
the other, with a wink and placing one finger to
the side of his flat nose, "I'll guarantee that they
are safe for as long as we want to keep 'em
penned up."
</p>

<p>
"Which will be till we hear from old Chisholm
Dacre regarding how much he is willing to give
up for his precious nephew and his chum," said
Dampier.
</p>

<p>
Soon after this, the rascals, in whose power
the unconscious boys were once more, entered
the old light-house.
</p>

<p>
They made a hearty meal, with many jests
and much laughter, in which the mysterious
prisoner, who has been mentioned by them once
or twice before, figured largely.  To judge by
their conversation, he was a man toward whom
they cherished the utmost hatred and malice.

<h3>
CHAPTER XX.
<br /><br />
THE ENEMY'S VICTORY.
</h3>

<p>
Evidently the peculiar color which the submarine
craft <i>Huron</i> had been painted answered
its purpose of practical invisibility excellently.
For the tug came right on, driving straight for
the diving boat, without any of those on board
apparently being aware of the proximity of the
queer vessel.
</p>

<p>
Tom's excitement and suspense were painful
as the tug drew closer.  Were his brother and
his chum on board?  How big a crew did the
tug carry?  What would be the outcome of the
plan, which had been determined upon after a
consultation, and which was nothing more nor
less than to hold up the tug and search her
thoroughly.
</p>

<p>
Beside Tom in the conning tower stood Obadiah
Ironsides, the professor and Jeff Trulliber.
Rosewater had been pressed into service as an
oiler in the engine room, while old Sam made
some trifling adjustments of the machinery.
</p>

<p>
The party had retired to the conning tower,
as they would be less conspicuous there than on
deck, and those on the tug would not take alarm.
It had been agreed upon, likewise, that Mr. Ironsides
was to carry on the preliminary questioning
of Rangler, or whoever was on board the tug,
as in that case, the rascals would not take alarm
and conceal Jack and Sandy, in the event that
they were on board.
</p>

<p>
Closer and closer ranged the tug, a great white
"bone" creaming at her bow.  As she got within
hailing distance, Mr. Ironsides emerged from
the conning tower and took up a position on
the submarine's deck.
</p>

<p>
"Ahoy!  On board the tug!" he shouted,
placing his hands funnel-wise to his mouth.
</p>

<p>
"Ahoy, yourself!" came back a rough voice
from the pilot-house of the tug.  "What sort of
a sea-going peanut roaster is that?"
</p>

<p>
"The submarine boat <i>Huron</i>.  I wish to speak
to you."
</p>

<p>
"Have to wait till some other time, then.
We're busy now," was the rejoinder, and the
window of the pilot-house, which had been raised
while Rangler thrust out his head, was slammed
down once more.
</p>

<p>
"Hold on, there!" cried Mr. Ironsides.  "I
must speak to you, I tell you.  It may have
serious consequences for you if you don't stop."
</p>

<p>
This speech was greeted with a derisive laugh
from the tug.  But presently it slackened speed
and the submarine crept up to it.
</p>

<p>
"Well, what do you want?" asked Rangler
harshly, leaning out of his pilot-house and
looking down on the gray whaleback of the
submarine.
</p>

<p>
"Food and water," said Mr. Ironsides, with
excusable prevarication.  "We have run out of
them."
</p>

<p>
"Serves you right for navigating the lakes in
that fool contrivance.  Well, I know the law.  I
suppose I'll have to give 'em to you.  Make fast
and come on board."
</p>

<p>
Tom, who could see all that was transpiring
from the conning tower without danger of being
seen, saw Mr. Ironsides spring lightly on board
after he had made fast a rope that two of the
crew of the tug threw to him.
</p>

<p>
"Wonder what he is going to do?" thought
the boy to himself, as he saw the inventor
leaping up the stairway leading to the pilot-house.
He entered the structure and could be seen
eagerly conversing with Captain Rangler.
</p>

<p>
As a matter of fact, the inventor had decided
on a bold stroke.  It was nothing more nor less
than to state his mission to Captain Rangler in
so many words, and represent himself as having
been sent out by the police of Rockport.
</p>

<p>
"Captain Rangler," he began, "my name is
Ironsides.  I am connected in an unofficial
capacity with the police of Rockport, from which place
you are suspected of having kidnapped two
boys.  I demand that I be allowed to search your
craft."
</p>

<p>
"What sort of talk is this?" blustered the
captain.  "Me&mdash;Captain Rangler&mdash;kidnap boys?
You're mistaken, my friend.  I'm not in any
such business."
</p>

<p>
"In that case, you will allow me, of course, to
search your craft?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly; go as far as you like.  But I'd have
you know that it hurts my feelings to be accused
of such rascality."
</p>

<p>
The crafty ruffian actually put on an injured
air, as he said this, as if he had been a man of
the highest integrity, righteously angered at a
false accusation.
</p>

<p>
So cleverly did he act, that even Mr. Ironsides
was dumfounded.
</p>

<p>
"I wonder if Tom Dacre wasn't mistaken?"
he thought to himself.  "This fellow appears to
be honest enough."
</p>

<p>
Aloud, however, he said:
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, captain.  I'll take advantage of
your offer and search your craft.  You understand,
of course, that this is no aspersion on your
character.  My orders are to search every craft
on the lake in search of the kidnapped lads."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, that's all right," said Captain Rangler
easily.  "Make yourself at home.  Go over this
here boat from stem to stern.  I'll warrant you'll
find nothing but what's legitimate."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Ironsides started from the cabin to begin
his search.  As he did so, Captain Rangler, who
was leaning out of the pilot-house window once
more, gave a perceptible start, and uttered an
exclamation.
</p>

<p>
Tom had, incautiously, ventured too close to
the lens of the conning tower, in his anxiety to
see what was going forward.  Captain Rangler,
who, up till that moment, had really believed that
Mr. Ironsides was a police investigator, instantly
recognized the lad, and also guessed what was
on foot.
</p>

<p>
"Jim," he called to a sailor, "I want you to
conduct Mr. Ironsides all over this craft.  Take
him everywhere.  Don't leave a spot uncovered&mdash;and
Jim"&mdash;the sailor came closer, while Rangler
sank his voice to a whisper&mdash;"don't let him come
on deck again.  You understand?"
</p>

<p>
The sailor nodded, and joining Mr. Ironsides,
made a great show of conducting him over the
tug.  They started in at the cabin, and by turns
visited every nook and corner of the craft.  The
last place visited was the forecastle, a stuffy little
hole in the bow of the tug.
</p>

<p>
"Well," said Mr. Ironsides, "I really see no
trace of any lads here.  I guess there must be
some mistake about it."
</p>

<p>
"I guess so, sir," said the sailor respectfully;
"must have got the wrong craft, sir."
</p>

<p>
"So it would seem.  However, my man, here's
a dollar for your trouble."  The sailor touched
his forelock and stuffed the bill into his pocket.
As he did so, he exclaimed suddenly:
</p>

<p>
"Beg pardon, sir.  Somebody on deck is calling
me.  Back in a minute, sir."
</p>

<p>
With monkey-like rapidity, he sprang toward a
ladder, and in a flash was on deck.
</p>

<p>
"I guess I might as well go, too," thought
the inventor, and was preparing to follow when
a startling thing happened.
</p>

<p>
The hatch by which they had entered was
suddenly clapped to.
</p>

<p>
"Here!  Here!" shouted the inventor, thinking
a mistake had been made.  "Let me out.
I'm&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You'll get out when we're good and ready,"
came a harsh voice from the other side of the
hatch.  At the same time the rasping sound of
a bolt being secured on the outside came to the
crestfallen inventor's ears.
</p>

<p>
While this scene was transpiring on the tug,
Captain Rangler and two of his men had slipped
from the stern of their craft down upon the deck
of the submarine.  Tiptoeing forward, as softly
as cats, they gained the conning tower.
</p>

<p>
A sharp, metallic clang was the first intimation
that Tom and his companions had that Captain
Rangler once more held the upper hand.
The hatch of the conning tower had been slammed
to by the ruffian, and the outside fastenings&mdash;used
when the submarine was in port&mdash;had been
locked.
</p>

<p>
Tom Dacre and the others were as effectually
prisoners on their own craft as Mr. Ironsides,
the inventor, was in the dark and malodorous
forepeak of the tug.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap21"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXI.
<br /><br />
"THERE IS A WAY&mdash;I MEAN TO TRY IT."
</h3>

<p>
The bitter chagrin felt by the eldest Dacre boy
and his companions at this sudden and disastrous
turn in their affairs may be better pictured than
written.  Consternation was upon each face.  The
professor was the first to recover his wits.
</p>

<p>
"What do you expect to gain by such conduct
as this, you rascal?" he cried at Captain Rangler
and his men, who were grinning triumphantly
through the lens of the conning tower at their
unlucky prisoners.
</p>

<p>
"I'll see that you go to jail for your misdeeds,
if ever I get a chance," shouted Jeff indignantly.
As for Tom, he felt too heartsick to say a
word.  In addition to their plight, they could now
be pretty certain that the inventor of the submarine
was likewise a prisoner, and that, moreover,
they were no closer to knowing anything
of the fate of Jack and Sandy.
</p>

<p>
It is doubtful if Captain Rangler heard the
remarks addressed to him; but, at any rate, he
guessed the purport of them.  He grinned
mockingly in response, and shouted back:
</p>

<p>
"You'll never get the upper hand of us, Tom
Dacre; try as you will."
</p>

<p>
His voice carried faintly, and Tom could not
help feeling that his words appeared to bear a
semblance of truth.
</p>

<p>
Just then old Sam and Rosewater, who had
heard the disturbance, came running up from
below.
</p>

<p>
"What's up?  What's the matter?" demanded
old Sam.
</p>

<p>
"Golly gracious, wha's happened now?" gasped
Rosewater.
</p>

<p>
"More misfortunes," said Tom, with a quaver
in his voice.  "Those rascals have trapped
Mr. Ironsides on board their craft and have
imprisoned us on the submarine."
</p>

<p>
Old Sam whistled.
</p>

<p>
"Phew!  We are in a fine fix, now.  What do
you suppose they mean to do with us?"
</p>

<p>
"I have not the least idea.  Maybe they hardly
know themselves.  I guess all they wish to do
is to keep us from informing the police of their
rascality."
</p>

<p>
"Humph!  Much good it would do, if all police
were like the Rockport crowd," commented the
professor.  "What the scoundrels need after
them is a detachment of Secret Service men."
</p>

<p>
"I wish we could notify them somehow.  But
it doesn't look as if we could do anything now
but await the outcome of the rascals' plans,"
sighed Jeff.
</p>

<p>
"Dem fellers would look mighty hansum decoratin'
some trees," put in Rosewater indignantly.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I guess they have made up their minds
what to do," said Tom presently.  "See, there
goes Captain Rangler and those other two
rascals back on board the tug."
</p>

<p>
"I wonder where they have got Mr. Ironsides
confined?" asked Sam disconsolately.
</p>

<p>
"It must be up in the forecastle.  I saw him
go down there with one of the sailors, and a
short time later the fellow came up alone,"
volunteered Tom.
</p>

<p>
"Hullo!  I guess they are going to take us in
tow!" cried Jeff presently.
</p>

<p>
The imprisoned party in the conning tower
watched eagerly while Rangler's men attached
ropes to the bitts on the bow of the submarine,
and, this done, the tug steamed ahead.
</p>

<p>
Presently the ropes tightened, and the
submarine began to move through the water after
the tug.
</p>

<p>
"Well!  If this doesn't beat a three-ring
circus!" exclaimed old Sam.  "Here we are, shut
up like a lot of babies, while the <i>Huron</i>, the
fastest craft in America, is towed over the lake by
an old tug."
</p>

<p>
The old man was boiling with indignation; so
were they all, in fact.  It was ignominious, to
say the least&mdash;the ease with which they had been
made captives.
</p>

<p>
"Where can they be going to take us?" asked
Jeff.
</p>

<p>
"Canada, maybe," suggested Tom; "and then
turn us loose in the wilds."
</p>

<p>
"I wouldn't be surprised if some such idea
had entered their heads," agreed the professor,
"but you must recollect that the Canadian coast
is well patroled, and if a strange vessel landed
there she would excite comment and investigation.
If she hadn't papers, she would get into
trouble."
</p>

<p>
"That's so," chimed in old Sam.  "I guess it
won't be Canada this trip.  More likely to be
one of their island hangouts."
</p>

<p>
"What will they do with us when they get us
there?" inquired Jeff.
</p>

<p>
"I cannot guess any more than you," rejoined
the professor.  "Leave us there, maybe, while
they make off to safety.  We are a menace to
them as long as we remain at large."
</p>

<p>
The others could not help but see it in this
light.  It was the logical thing for the gang of
ruffians to do to dispose of such dangerous foes
as Tom Dacre and his party had become.  But
how did they mean to do it?  That was the
engrossing question.
</p>

<p>
As has been said, it was sundown when the tug
hove in sight.  Now it grew dark with great
rapidity.
</p>

<p>
"Well, we might as well put as bold a face as
possible on our predicament," said the professor.
"Let's have some light, Sam."
</p>

<p>
"All right," rejoined the old man.  "I'll go
below and turn on the dynamo."
</p>

<p>
In a few minutes a cheerful light flooded
the submarine from stern to bow.  Its rays
streamed out through the lenses of the conning
tower, and revealed an unwelcome sight.  Two
sailors from the tug, armed with rifles, were
seated on the deck, smoking and making themselves
as comfortable as possible.  But they were
unmistakably on the alert in case any attempt at
escape was made.
</p>

<p>
"If I only knew how Jack and Sandy were faring,
I'd feel better," said Tom, soon after this
discovery had been made.
</p>

<p>
"You feel bettah, sah, if you hab some suppah,"
said Rosewater, thrusting his head into the
conning tower from below.  The faithful black
had vanished some time before, unnoticed, and
had devoted his time to preparing as good a
meal as if nothing had happened to mar the
harmony of life on the diving boat.
</p>

<p>
Despite their disturbed feelings, they all did
justice to the meal, and actually felt a little
better after it.
</p>

<p>
While they ate, the rushing of the water
against the submarine's sides told them that they
were still being towed, and at a good rate of
speed, too.  But of their destination they were,
of course, as much in the dark as ever.
</p>

<p>
It must have been about ten o'clock that night
that the motion ceased, and, peering out through
the lenses, they could see lights flashing about
on the deck of the tug.  Evidently they were
coming to an anchorage.
</p>

<p>
Looking in the other direction, they could now
espy the dark, jagged outlines of some sort of
land, although, of where they were, they had, of
course, not the slightest idea.  Old Sam inclined
to the opinion&mdash;which turned out to be correct&mdash;that
they had passed through the Straits of
Mackinac and were in Lake Michigan.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly, from the shore, a bright blue light
flashed out through the darkness.  It appeared
and vanished three times.  The signal was
answered from the tug.  Soon afterward, although
the prisoners on the submarine did not, naturally,
know this, a boat was lowered from the side of
the tug, and Captain Rangler, with a few of
his worthies, was rowed ashore.
</p>

<p>
"What are you thinking of, Tom?" asked the
professor late that same night.
</p>

<p>
The captives of the diving-boat had not retired
to rest, but were sitting up in the lighted cabin,
anxiously awaiting some sign as to what their
fate was to be.
</p>

<p>
Tom had been silent for some time.  He sat
motionless, except when he made a few sketches
with a stub of pencil on the back of an old
envelope.  It was clear to one who knew him that
the boy was revolving some plan.
</p>

<p>
"I've been thinking that if only we had
Mr. Ironsides on board to navigate the submarine,
we might escape," said Tom.
</p>

<p>
"That's so," agreed Jeff; "if those rapscallions
took after us, we could dive under and easily
elude them."
</p>

<p>
"I'd rather fight 'em," declared old Sam
stoutly.
</p>

<p>
"Well, what is your plan, Tom?" inquired the
professor.
</p>

<p>
"My plan is to get Mr. Ironsides back on
board," announced Tom quietly.
</p>

<p>
The sheer audaciousness of this proposal made
even the staid professor emit a whistle of
astonishment.
</p>

<p>
"Im-possible," he declared, with finality.
</p>

<p>
"Not at all, if we could get out of the
submarine," persisted Tom.
</p>

<p>
"But we can't.  Even if we unbolted a plate
or one of the lenses and squeezed through, there
are still two armed men on the deck.  There is
no way."
</p>

<p>
"There <i>is</i> a way, and I mean to try it,"
declared Tom.  "Listen."
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap22"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXII.
<br /><br />
A BIT OF MADCAP DARING.
</h3>

<p>
"You mean that there is a way of escaping
from this craft?" demanded old Sam incredulously.
"Well, lad, I know the <i>Huron</i> pretty well,
from her keel plates up, but I can't figure one."
</p>

<p>
"How about the torpedo tube?" inquired Tom
calmly.
</p>

<p>
"Wow!" cried the old man.  "I begin to get
your meaning, now.  But could it be done?"
</p>

<p>
"It can be tried," said Tom.  "As I understand
it, when the <i>Huron</i> is floating on the surface her
torpedo tube is submerged to a depth of about
four feet."
</p>

<p>
"Ker-rect," declared old Sam.
</p>

<p>
"The outer end is so devised that it is closed
and water-tight till a torpedo is fired and shoves
it open.  It is this which enables the projectile
to be loaded without endangering the flooding of
the boat."
</p>

<p>
"Ker-rect again, my lad; go on.  We're all
listening.  But you're wrong in one point.  The
torpedo tube is not opened by the passage of the
torpedo through it.  It is opened by the
operation of a lever in the conning tower."
</p>

<p>
"So much the better," said Tom.  "Now, then,
my plan is this: I will creep into the torpedo
tube.  When I am inside it, one of you will close
the inside end.  The outer end will then be opened
by Sam, who will remain by the opening lever.
As the water rushes in, I will dive outward and
shoot up to the surface.  We know pretty well
where Mr. Ironsides is confined.  I shall swim to
the bow of the tug and see what chance there
is of getting him out.  If there is any, you can
rest assured that he will be back here within an
hour."
</p>

<p>
"Bravo!" cried Sam.  "That's a bully plan, my lad."
</p>

<p>
"Preposterous!" spoke the professor.  "I shall
not permit you to risk your life in any such mad
fashion."
</p>

<p>
"It won't be risking it," protested Tom; "at
any rate, none of us can be worse off than we are
here.  As for the danger, it's no more dangerous
than taking a dive off a springboard, only, in this
case, the process is reversed.  I shall go up,
instead of down."
</p>

<p>
The upshot of it was that Tom had his way.
He kicked off his shoes and all his garments but
his underclothes.  Thus attired, he was ready
for his great attempt.
</p>

<p>
"But how on earth are you going to get back
on board again?" exclaimed the professor, just
as all was ready.
</p>

<p>
Oddly enough, none of them had thought of
this, and, for a moment, the objection threw cold
water on their hopes.  But it seemed that Tom
had figured this out, too.  But he was not quite
ready to announce it.
</p>

<p>
"Friends, will you trust me for getting in
again, if only I can rescue Mr. Ironsides?" he
said simply and without bravado.
</p>

<p>
"You bet we will, lad," quoth old Sam heartily.
"A lad with a figure-head like you on his bows
ought to be able to carry anything through."
</p>

<p>
Tom, the professor and Jeff then descended
to the torpedo-room, while old Sam stood ready
at the lever, which, at the signal from below, was
to be so manipulated as to throw open the outer
end of the tube.
</p>

<p>
"Good-by, and good luck," said the professor,
with a warm clasp of the hand, as the inner end
of the tube was opened and Tom crept into its
narrow confines.
</p>

<p>
"It's so-long,&mdash;not good-by," laughed the lad
lightly.  "All ready, now, professor.  Close the
inner door and give the signal as soon as you
like."
</p>

<p>
The metal fastenings closed behind Tom with
a clash.  He lay in total darkness within the tube,
which was just large enough to permit him to
lie outstretched at full length.
</p>

<p>
"I'm a human torpedo with a vengeance,"
thought the lad, as he awaited in the darkness the
opening of the outer door of the tube.  Thinly
clad as he was, the metal chilled his skin.  For
the first time since he had embarked on the
adventure Tom felt a slight nervous thrill run through
him.
</p>

<p>
Suppose he should be caught in the mechanism
at the mouth of the tube?  In that case he would
drown as miserably as a rat.  These and a dozen
other thoughts ran through his excited mind, as
he lay there waiting, through what was really
only a short period, but which seemed an eternity.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly a slight click could be heard.  Tom
braced himself; the outer door was about to open
and the water would rush in on him.  He drew
a long breath, filling his lungs to the bursting
point.  The next instant the outer door of the
tube was opened and in rushed the water.  It
seemed to Tom as if he had been struck by a
steam-hammer, so great was its force in the
confined place.  But he kept his wits and struck out,
and in a flash, as it seemed, he was on the
surface of the water outside the submarine.
</p>

<p>
The first move of his daring game had been
accomplished.  Far more difficult, however, was
what lay beyond.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately, it was pitchy dark.  As he came
to the surface, Tom noticed that the air smelled
sulphurous and heavy.  He decided that a
thunderstorm was brewing.  In fact, he presently
became aware of livid, snake-like flashes afar off.
</p>

<p>
Tom trod the water for a time while he looked
about him.  He was quite close to the bow of the
submarine, and, by stretching out his hand, could
have touched her sides.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly, a sound that he recognized as snoring
smote on his ear.  It came from the guards
who had been posted on the deck of the diving-boat.
</p>

<p>
"Good!" thought Tom.  "So far, everything is
fine.  Now, if the luck will only hold, I'll have
Mr. Ironsides on board in no time."
</p>

<p>
He struck out for the tug, which could be
made out&mdash;a dark blot on the water&mdash;at no
considerable distance.  He speedily reached her side
and snuggled in under the guard rail, where he
was out of sight, till he could get the "lay of the
land."
</p>

<p>
Two men were talking on deck.  Tom listened
intently.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Hick," came one voice, "it looks like a
lonely watch for you and me."
</p>

<p>
"It does that, Joe.  Here's the skipper ashore,
and all the others gets a chance to stretch their
legs but us.  We've got to stay and guard that
pesky submarine fellow in the forepeak."
</p>

<p>
"He won't take much guarding, I'm thinking,"
was the rejoinder; "that padlock's good and tight,
and it's too warm down in there fer him to
indulge in strenuous exercise."
</p>

<p>
"Tell you what," struck in the other man,
"we're alone, and no one can report to the
captain.  Let's have a game of cards to while away
the time.  There's a deck of pasteboards in the
skipper's cabin, and we can sit down there, snug
and sociable."
</p>

<p>
"That's a good idea.  I'd like to get them two
chaps off the submarine to join us.  I guess their
watch is as lonely as ours."
</p>

<p>
"I'd like to get 'em, too.  But the skipper's
taken the only boat.  The same one those two
kids ran off with."
</p>

<p>
The voices died away, and the two guardians
of the tug evidently had gone below to indulge
in their game of cards.
</p>

<p>
Tom's heart beat high with hope.  His plan
was succeeding beyond even his expectations.
He had confirmation of the fact that Mr. Ironsides
was imprisoned in the forepeak, and then,
too, the only men on the ship were safe astern
engrossed in a game.
</p>

<p>
One other thing in their conversation had
struck Tom sharply.  "The boat those two kids
ran off with."
</p>

<p>
That must mean that Jack and Sandy had
escaped.  No other interpretation could be put on
it.  But where were the two lads?  Tom would
have given a lot to know right then.
</p>

<p>
But it was no time for speculation.  The
necessity for action was immediate.  At any moment,
for all he knew, the men might come back from
the shore, and then "good-by" to his hopes of
freeing the inventor.
</p>

<p>
The lad crept along the side of the tug till he
reached the bow.  Then he clambered up the
anchor-chain, and in a jiffy stood&mdash;a wet,
half-clothed figure&mdash;on the fore deck.
</p>

<p>
"I must look like a ghost or something, in these
white clothes," thought the lad to himself, as he
felt about in the darkness for the forescuttle.
Finally he found it, and softly tapped on it.
</p>

<p>
"Who's there?" came a voice from below,
which he delightedly recognized as that of
Mr. Ironsides.
</p>

<p>
"Hush!  It's me&mdash;Tom Dacre!" whispered the
boy.  "Are you all right?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, but I am weak from lack of food and
the heat in this place."
</p>

<p>
"I'll soon have you out of there," comforted
Tom.  "Just trust in me."
</p>

<p>
"I will, my boy," came the rejoinder.  "You
inspire one with confidence."
</p>

<p>
Tom, as well as he could in the darkness,
examined the padlock.  It was a heavy one, but the
hasp seemed to be more or less loose.  Possibly
Mr. Ironsides' efforts to escape had had that
effect.  At any rate, Tom thought that if only
he could get the instrument with which to do it,
he could pry up the hasp and free his friend.
</p>

<p>
But the question was, where to obtain that
implement.  While he was still casting about in his
mind, a heavy footfall resounded, and, from
round the corner of the pilot-house a figure
emerged, making directly for the boy.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap23"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXIII.
<br /><br />
BRAINS AND GRIT&mdash;A COMBINATION HARD TO BEAT.
</h3>

<p>
Tom's heart beat like a trip-hammer.  Discovery
and failure of his enterprise seemed almost
inevitable.  But he retained presence of mind
enough to slip behind the big steam windlass
while the man advanced.
</p>

<p>
The fellow was one of those left to guard the
tug, and was more vigilant than Tom had
supposed would be the case, judging by the
conversation he had overheard.  He had come forward
to see that all was well.
</p>

<p>
Apparently he had not seen Tom, thanks to the
darkness and the fact that he had just emerged
from a lighted cabin.  He walked up to the
scuttle, however, and rapped on it with his
knuckles in much the same way that Tom had
done.
</p>

<p>
The boy's blood almost froze in his veins, as,
in response to the man's rappings, he heard
Mr. Ironsides' voice come from below.
</p>

<p>
"Hurry up, Tom.  Get me out of here, quick!
I can't stand it much longer."
</p>

<p>
"Gee whiz, the poor chap's gone crazy,"
muttered the man, to Tom's intense relief.  "Well,
I've no orders, except to keep him in there, crazy
or not, so I'll just see that the fastenings are all
right, and then go back to the game."
</p>

<p>
He drew a hatchet from his belt, and gave the
nails that held the loose hasp a few blows with it.
As he was doing this, clumsily enough in the
darkness, he hit his thumb a hard blow.  Tom
heard an exclamation and a volley of strong
language.
</p>

<p>
"Confound it," exclaimed the man, flinging the
hatchet from him in a rage, "that's the second
time in a week I pounded that thumb.  Bad luck
to it."
</p>

<p>
He strode off toward the stern once more,
leaving Tom in a state of joy that may be imagined,
for, in the flung hatchet, Tom had just the very
tool he wanted to liberate Mr. Ironsides.
</p>

<p>
Guessing that the man would not be back for
some time, now that he had, as he thought, made
certain that all was secure, Tom lost no time in
finding the hatchet and went to work on the hasp.
As he had suspected, it didn't take very long
to work it loose.  Then, placing the blade of his
implement under it, he gave it a good wrench.
Out came the hasp, as easily as if it had been
fastened in cheese instead of solid wood.
</p>

<p>
The next instant Mr. Ironsides was by Tom's
side, and the two were shaking hands warmly by
the side of the opened scuttle.  It was no time
for the interchange of words, but Tom told him
swiftly just what had happened.  The inventor's
praise of the brave, resourceful lad was warmer
than ever.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Ironsides, who had some changes of apparel
on board his craft, rapidly divested himself
of his clothes, as Tom had done.
</p>

<p>
"I'll leave them behind as souvenirs," he said,
giving the pile of garments a shove with his foot.
</p>

<p>
This done, they both slipped silently over the
bow, and dropped into the water.  As they did so,
a rumble of thunder was heard, and a vivid flash
of forked lightning split the sky.
</p>

<p>
"We're in for a storm, all right," commented Tom.
</p>

<p>
"So much the better," said the inventor, as they
swam side by side toward the submarine, "the
worst storm can't hurt the <i>Huron</i>.  All I have
to do is to sink a few feet, and the waves can
rage as they like.  They don't bother her."
</p>

<p>
Excessive caution was necessary as they neared
the submarine.  The two sentinels might still be
asleep, and then, again, the noise of the
approaching storm might have awakened them.  In
any event, the two adventurers made no more
noise than was unavoidable as they neared the
side of the diving craft.
</p>

<p>
They swam round to the bow of the <i>Huron</i>
and clambered cautiously out of the water.  Tom
wished that he had told Sam to turn out the
lights when he left the craft, for the rays from
the conning tower shone out brightly, illuminating
the decks with a radiance almost like day.
</p>

<p>
But the light showed them one thing, at least.
This was that the two sentries were still sound
asleep, doubtless never imagining for a moment
that there was the slightest chance of those on
board the diving craft receiving help.  Indeed, if
it had not been for Tom's ingenuity and courage,
this would have been the case.
</p>

<p>
Noiselessly, almost, the two adventurers made
for the conning tower.  They crept silently along
over the deck in their bare feet and gained the
helmet-like structure without a hitch occurring.
</p>

<p>
"Now to open up our prison," whispered Tom,
as Mr. Ironsides examined the bolt by which
Captain Rangler had imprisoned them.
</p>

<p>
It was furnished with a lock, but, luckily,
Captain Rangler had had no key to fit it.  The lock,
in fact, was not needed, so long as the inmates
of the submarine were within.  But now Mr. Ironsides
slid back the bolt without difficulty and
opened the hatch.
</p>

<p>
He had just opened it, and was about to step
within, when one of the sentries awakened.  At
the same instant came a flash of lightning.  It
showed the man two white-clad figures, hovering
about the conning tower.
</p>

<p>
A sudden access of superstitious terror seized
him.  So far as he knew, there was no possible
way of emerging from the conning tower.  These
two white figures, then, must be beings from
another world.
</p>

<p>
With a wild yell he flung himself into the
water, and began swimming with might and
main for the tug.  His shouts aroused his
companion.  He, however, was cast in another mold.
He realized almost instantly that an escape had
been effected in some manner.  Raising his rifle,
he began firing at the two figures.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-256"></a>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-256.jpg" alt="Raising his rifle, he began firing at the two figures." />
<br />
Raising his rifle, he began firing at the two figures.
</p>

<p>
"Duck, Tom," ordered Mr. Ironsides, "those
bullets can't pierce the metal."
</p>

<p>
Bang! bang! bang! bang! bang!
</p>

<p>
The weapon the sentry was using was an
automatic.  The bullets flew in a constant stream.
Tom counted ten.  He knew the type of weapon,
and knew, too, that when his magazine was
exhausted the sentry would have to refill it.
</p>

<p>
"Now, then," he cried to Mr. Ironsides.  "Now
is our chance to grab him."
</p>

<p>
The two darted forward across the deck, and,
before the sentry could reload, they were upon
him.  Tom was in no mood to be merciful.
</p>

<p>
"Can you swim?" he demanded of the fellow,
who gave in without a struggle.
</p>

<p>
"Y-y-y-y-yes!" responded the other, with
chattering teeth.
</p>

<p>
"Then over you go!" cried Mr. Ironsides.
One!  Two!  Three!
</p>

<p>
Overboard went that sentry with a resounding
splash.  The manner in which he struck out for
the tug convinced Tom, rather to his relief, that
the man was in no danger of drowning.
</p>

<p>
All this had occurred in such a short time that
those below in the cabin had only arrived on deck
in time to see the finale.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Tom, is it really you?" cried Jeff, rushing
forward and wringing Tom's hand warmly.
</p>

<p>
"Guess it is," laughed the boy; "and, best of
all, here's Mr. Ironsides."
</p>

<p>
"You have succeeded beyond my wildest expectations,"
cried the professor.  "It's wonderful,
wonderful!"
</p>

<p>
But in the midst of the congratulations and
joyous reunion, the bushes on shore suddenly
began to spit fire.  A volley also came from the
tug.  The first sentry had reached the vessel and
reported what had occurred, and the two men left
to guard Mr. Ironsides were not long in
discovering that their bird had flown.
</p>

<p>
As for the fire from the shore, it came from
Captain Rangler and the others in the tower, who
had guessed instantly, when the sentry opened
fire, that something had happened to free their
prisoners.
</p>

<p>
Bullets spattered on the water about them, and
pinged on the metal deck of the <i>Huron</i>.
</p>

<p>
"Wow!  This is a regular bee-hive!" exclaimed
Mr. Ironsides.
</p>

<p>
"We must cast off without delay," cried Tom.
"They have taken the alarm with a vengeance."
</p>

<p>
Suddenly, from the shore, the brilliant light
of a Bengal torch flooded the whole scene with a
bright blue glare.
</p>

<p>
Tom darted forward and cast off the towing
ropes, which still attached the submarine to the
tug.  In the meantime, Sam had the engines
started once more.
</p>

<p>
The lad's post, while he was casting off the
towline, was not a bed of roses.  Although he
crouched behind the metal bits, he could hear
the rattle of lead all about him.  Having cast off
the ropes, there was nothing for him to do but
to await his chance to regain the conning tower.
The others had, by this time, sought its shelter
as there was no use in risking death in that
hailstorm of bullets.  Mr. Ironsides' first act had
been to lower the steel bullet-proof shades,
specially designed for protecting the conning tower
lenses in just such an emergency.  These "shades"
had slits pierced in them so that the steersman
could see out without much danger of being hit,
even in the hottest fire.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly the Bengal light died down.  Darkness
ensued for an instant while those on shore
lighted another one.  Under cover of the
blackness, Tom darted for the conning tower.
Mr. Ironsides was at the wheel, the engines were
humming, everything was in readiness for an
instant start.  As Tom dashed into the conning
tower, and the water-tight door was closed,
another Bengal light was aflame.  By its light the
submarine became a hotter target than ever.
</p>

<p>
The bullets spattering against the metal skin
of the craft sounded like hail on a tin roof.  But,
thanks to the secret alloy in the metal of which
the <i>Huron</i> was constructed, they were deflected
from her, hardly leaving a scratch to show where
they had struck.
</p>

<p>
"Ready?" yelled Mr. Ironsides down the
speaking tube to Sam in the engine room.
</p>

<p>
"Ready, sir!" bellowed back the engineer of
the <i>Huron</i>.
</p>

<p>
"Then brace yourselves for a dive," commanded
the inventor.
</p>

<p>
A mighty, hissing sound ensued, as the tanks
filled.  The <i>Huron</i> dipped by the nose, and sank
gradually, as the inventor, once below the
surface, didn't wish to risk a collision with the
bottom, and he did not know how much water they
had off shore.
</p>

<p>
After the exciting scenes through which they
had just passed, the depths seemed calm and
peaceful and soothing to the nerves.  Obadiah
switched on the searchlight and raised the
bullet-proof "shades," and they were able to look out
once more at the glass-green vastness about
them.
</p>

<p>
It was not till then that old Sam came up from
below.
</p>

<p>
"Beg pardon, sir," said he to Mr. Ironsides,
"but I know that there island, sir."
</p>

<p>
"So it was an island, eh?" said Mr. Ironsides.
"What island was it, Sam?"
</p>

<p>
"Castle Rock Island!" burst out Tom.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir; that was it, for a fact," said old
Sam.  "I recognized it by the ruined tower, when
the light flared up and showed it."
</p>

<p>
"Then that is the place where Captain Rangler
and that outfit make their headquarters!"
exclaimed the professor.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, and I'll bet a doughnut that that is
where Jack and Sandy are confined!" burst out
Tom, with blazing eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Ironsides, we cannot run off and leave
them like this!" he continued in an impassioned
way.
</p>

<p>
"I agree with you, Tom.  But what are we to do?"
</p>

<p>
"Hang about till daylight, and then cruise
round the island.  We may see some signs of
them.  Judging from what I overheard on the
tug, there is a bare chance they may have escaped."
</p>

<p>
"Tom Dacre, you are a brave lad," said the
inventor, for the second time that night; "and,
better still, you mix brains with your grit.  That's
a combination that's hard to beat in man or boy."
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXIV.
<br /><br />
"COWARD!"
</h3>

<p>
"Sandy!"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Sandy!</i>"
</p>

<p>
"SANDY!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, what is it?"
</p>

<p>
Sandy MacTavish sat up on the bed in the
tower room to find Jack bending over him.
</p>

<p>
It was pitchy dark.  So soundly had the exhausted
lads slept that they had taken no account
of the hours.
</p>

<p>
"Hoot mon!" exclaimed the Scotch lad, wide-awake
in an instant, "it's nicht."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, it is night," rejoined Jack; "we must
have slept for hours and hours."
</p>

<p>
"I hope that mon didnae call us to take that
steamer."
</p>

<p>
"Sandy, I don't believe there is any steamer."
</p>

<p>
"What!"
</p>

<p>
"I mean what I say.  This looks to me like a
trap."
</p>

<p>
"What, another one?"
</p>

<p>
"Hush!  Listen to me.  Just before I dropped
off to sleep, I've a kind of a shadowy
recollection of hearing that door being locked."
</p>

<p>
"And you didna investigate?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm ashamed to say I didn't.  Not that it
would have done any good, anyhow.  I was too
sleepy, I guess.  But when I woke up, just now,
I went over to the door, and&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"It is locked."
</p>

<p>
"You're right.  And it's stout and firm, too."
</p>

<p>
"Let's shout.  It may be an accident."
</p>

<p>
"Not much chance of that.  I've worse news
for you, Sandy.  Something that shows that it
was by no accident that door became locked."
</p>

<p>
"How's that?"
</p>

<p>
Sandy sat on the edge of the bed, peering into
the darkness where Jack's form was dimly
visible.
</p>

<p>
"Walstein and Dampier are in this place!"
</p>

<p>
"Here?  In this tower?" gasped Sandy incredulously.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I heard them whispering at the door
when I woke up.  I recognized their voices.  That
rascal who took us in here has robbed me, too."
</p>

<p>
"He has, eh, the gloomeroon!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, he took every penny out of my pocket
while we were sleeping."
</p>

<p>
"How did you discover this?"
</p>

<p>
"I overheard something while they were
whispering at the door that made me suspicious.  I
heard Walstein tell the man that he had got his
share of whatever ransom they made out of us,
when he picked my pockets."
</p>

<p>
"And then you looked in them?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course."
</p>

<p>
"And they were empty?"
</p>

<p>
"Sandy, you almost make me laugh.  Of course
they were."
</p>

<p>
"A-well, I dinna see what good money would
do us now," quoth Sandy philosophically.  "So
they are going to hold us for ransom?"
</p>

<p>
"So I judged.  Moreover, I learned from what
I heard that we are on an island.  Guess what
one?"
</p>

<p>
"I dinna ken; De'il's Island, perhaps."
</p>

<p>
"On Castle Rock Island."
</p>

<p>
"Ho! ho! ho!" chuckled Sandy, who as ever
refused to be downcast, "prisoners on my dad's
ain property.  That's a good joke."
</p>

<p>
"I fail to see where the joke comes in, just at
present," rejoined Jack.  "These are desperate
men.  They won't stop at anything.  Sandy,
we've got to find some way to get out of this
mess."
</p>

<p>
"Well, we canna' go by the door."
</p>

<p>
"No; and even if it were open, those two dogs
are guarding it.  I heard that man who brought
us here tell them to 'watch.'"
</p>

<p>
"Aye!  They're a vera nice pair o' dogs, that.
That is, they'd be nice if they had nickel steel
muzzles on."
</p>

<p>
"Say, I wish you'd cut out your joking for a
while, Sandy.  This is a serious matter.  We
don't wish our friends to have to pay big
ransoms for us.  I'd hate to think of those rascals
winning out after all, and getting rich on their
scoundrelly ways, too."
</p>

<p>
"So would I," agreed Sandy, suddenly serious.
"I tell you what, Jack, did you notice that spiral
stairway outside the tower?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I noticed it when we came in.  Why?"
</p>

<p>
"Weel, I'm thinking that yon bit window must
look out on that same stairway."
</p>

<p>
"Suppose it does?  How are we to reach the
window?"
</p>

<p>
"Pile up some of the furniture on the bed.  I
guess we could easily reach it that way.  It's
no vera big, but I'm thinking we could manage
to squeeze through, if we reached it."
</p>

<p>
"By George, Sandy, it's worth trying, anyhow.
Let's set about it at once.  But be careful
not to make any noise moving the furniture.
They might guess what we are at."
</p>

<p>
"That's so.  We must be careful."
</p>

<p>
Very cautiously the two lads dragged the bed
to a position below the small window.  Then they
piled the rickety bureau on that, and on the top
of the last-named bit of furniture they stood a
chair.
</p>

<p>
Sandy was the first to clamber up.  It was
slow work, for the stack of furniture was rickety,
and threatened to collapse with a crash at any
instant.
</p>

<p>
But at last he gained the summit and wriggled
his active body half through the window.  It was
too dark outside to see much, and the lad
determined on a characteristically bold step.
Squirming through the small casement, he let himself
drop, holding by his hands to the window-ledge,
while he felt about beneath him with his feet.
</p>

<p>
To his intense joy, he could feel his toe-tips
encounter a projection from the wall of the tower,
which he judged must be the outside stairway
they had noticed.
</p>

<p>
"Come on!" he called softly to Jack, and then
he gently dropped.  As he had suspected, he
found himself standing on the stairway, which
seemed to be staunch and firm.
</p>

<p>
Sandy tested it by rocking back and forth with
his face to the rough wall of the tower.  There
was no tremor from the stones beneath him.
</p>

<p>
"Noo, if all goes well, we'll be free again,"
he muttered to himself, as he awaited Jack's coming.
</p>

<p>
Presently, in spite of the darkness, he saw the
other lad's head projected through the window
above him.
</p>

<p>
"Is it all right?" asked Jack in a low whisper.
</p>

<p>
"As fine as silk," came back the rejoinder.
"Just climb through and then drop down beside
me.  It's a bonnie staircase."
</p>

<p>
"Funny they haven't got it guarded," commented
Jack, as he obeyed Sandy's instructions,
and in another instant was by his chum's side.
</p>

<p>
"It does seem queer.  But maybe they never
figured on our escaping by this way."
</p>

<p>
"Maybe that's it," agreed Jack, little guessing
the real reason that no sentry was posted on the
stone stairway.
</p>

<p>
"Now we'd better hug the wall going down,"
observed Sandy.  "We don't know how far out
the steps extend, and if we step off it would be
awkward."
</p>

<p>
"Awkward!  We might be killed!" exclaimed Jack.
</p>

<p>
"That's so, too," agreed Sandy in his usual
matter-of-fact tones.
</p>

<p>
He seemed quite calm and cool, while Jack's
heart was beating wildly and his pulses throbbing
painfully.
</p>

<p>
"Now then, easy does it!" observed Sandy, and
he began to descend the stone stairway with due
caution.
</p>

<p>
Jack followed, keeping as close to the walls as
he could.  He could not help feeling conscious
of the black void that yawned on the outer end
of the projecting steps.
</p>

<p>
"Hoots!  There's going to be a storm before
long!" exclaimed Sandy suddenly, as a vivid flash
of lightning ripped the sky.
</p>

<p>
It was the same that Tom was observing at
that instant as he embarked on his perilous mission.
</p>

<p>
The flash, short as it had been, had sufficed to
show Jack the true peril of their path.  The stairs
were not more than eighteen inches wide.  At
one time there may have been a balustrade on the
outer edge.  But, if this had ever been the case,
it had vanished now.  Jack felt an odd sinking
at the pit of his stomach, as he saw the ground
beneath them illumined for that brief molecule of
time.  It looked fearfully far off.  He could not
help picturing in his imagination the fatal
results of a misstep.
</p>

<p>
But Sandy had none of these qualms of fear.
He went right ahead, exercising due caution, it
is true.  But his mind was more busy with the
real peril of discovery than with the thought that
a false step might plunge its maker down to
death.
</p>

<p>
He was proceeding thus, step by step, when
he halted abruptly.  His outstretched foot had
encountered vacancy.
</p>

<p>
"Hoots!  What's this?" thought Sandy.
</p>

<p>
At that instant came another flash.  What it
revealed made even the stout-hearted Scotch lad
quiver and sicken for an instant.
</p>

<p>
No steps lay beyond his foot.
</p>

<p>
Instead, there was a dark void where several
of the stones had fallen out.  One step more, and
Sandy would have been dashed to the earth, he
did not know how many feet below.  Perspiration
broke out in tiny pin-points all over him.
</p>

<p>
What were they going to do?
</p>

<p>
Suddenly came another flash.  It showed the
lad that the gap was not in reality more than a
few feet wide.  On the farther side the steps
went on again, encircling the tower.
</p>

<p>
Sandy made up his mind instantly as to their
course of action.  They must jump.  On the
ground it would have been nothing to an active
lad of almost any age.  But the idea of leaping
that gulf high up on the side of the old
lighthouse was a repellent one.
</p>

<p>
Then, too, there was the chance that the stones
beyond might not be firmly fixed in place.  In
that case, the force of any one alighting on them
might send them crashing down through space,
bearing the jumper with them.
</p>

<p>
"A-weel, the longer I think about it, the worse
it gets," thought Sandy, "I must jump and have
it over with."
</p>

<p>
Jack was pressing close behind him now.
</p>

<p>
"What's the matter, Sandy?" he asked.  "Why
don't you go on?"
</p>

<p>
"Jack, we've got a bit of jumping to do,"
responded Sandy bravely.  He knew that Jack's
nature was rather imaginative and high-strung,
and he dreaded the task of persuading the lad to
jump.  Yet it must be done.  They could not
turn back now.  It was either discovery or else
progression.
</p>

<p>
"You see, Jack," he explained gently, "one or
two steps are missing right here.  But there's
some bonnie ones on the other side.  Now, all
we've got to do is to jump across, do you
understand?"
</p>

<p>
As he spoke, the Scotch lad could feel Jack
Dacre quiver as he pressed against him.
</p>

<p>
Don't think for a minute that the lad was a
coward.  He had proven his mettle on many a
hard-fought diamond and gridiron.  But his
imagination was lively.  Already Jack was picturing
the consequences if the jump was miscalculated.
Sandy saw that it would only increase the other's
fears if they lingered.
</p>

<p>
By the light of the flash that had revealed his
peril to him, the lad had calculated the jump.
And now, with a murmured prayer on his lips,
he made it.
</p>

<p>
Out into space, he flew, and the next instant
landed safe and sound across the gulf.  Nerve
and pluck will conquer many such gulfs and
voids.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">

<br />
Out into space he flew, and the next instant landed safe <br />
and sound across the gulf.
</p>

<p>
But with Jack, it was different.  Try as he
would, he could not nerve himself for the leap
into blackness.  He felt he would almost rather
be recaptured than face the jump.
</p>

<p>
"Come on!" cried Sandy encouragingly out of
the darkness, "mon, it's too easy."
</p>

<p>
"I can't, Sandy!  I can't!" came back Jack
Dacre's voice.
</p>

<p>
Sandy noted that it held a quiver of real fear,
and he didn't much blame his chum for it.
</p>

<p>
But Jack must be gotten across that chasm
somehow.  How was it to be done?  Sandy tried
to laugh off the perils.
</p>

<p>
"It isn't that," quavered Jack.  "I'm not really
afraid of it.  I don't know what the feeling is.
But Sandy, I can almost see myself lying at the
foot of the tower with all my bones broken."
</p>

<p>
"Rubbish," laughed Sandy.  "I'm not near as
good at the broad jump as you, and yet I made
it all right."
</p>

<p>
"I know.  But&mdash;but&mdash;you go on, Sandy.  Get
help, if you can.  I'm going back.  I can't do it.
I can't!"
</p>

<p>
Then Sandy had an inspiration.
</p>

<p>
"Coward!" he hissed, putting all the contempt
he could into the words.  "Coward!"
</p>

<p>
It was then that Jack Dacre found himself.
Burning with anger and humiliation, he leaped
forward into the night, to be caught by Sandy
at the other side of the gulf.
</p>

<p>
"Good for you!" exclaimed Sandy, as the
comrades clasped hands.  "I knew you'd do it."
</p>

<p>
"Not if it hadn't been for you, Sandy,"
breathed Jack.  "You saved me from recapture,
and&mdash;and&mdash;something else."
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXV.
<br /><br />
WHAT WILL HAPPEN NEXT?&mdash;CONCLUSION.
</h3>

<p>
"Well, that explains why the stairway wasn't
guarded, all right," commented Sandy, as they
continued their way.
</p>

<p>
They had reached the bottom, and were about
to strike off across the flat beach, when a figure
suddenly emerged from the door of the lighthouse.
</p>

<p>
At the same time, as bad luck would have it, a
flash of lightning from the nearing storm
revealed the lads' figures clearly.  But it did more
than that, it showed Sandy that the man
approaching them was followed by two or three
others.
</p>

<p>
The fellow gave a shout as he saw the boys,
and started for them.  They dodged, and were
about to make off, when another man blocked
their path.
</p>

<p>
"Inside the light-house!" gasped Sandy.  "It's
empty, I think!"
</p>

<p>
"Good!" exclaimed Jack.  "If we can get in
there and bolt the door, we are safe against a
siege."
</p>

<p>
The two lads doubled like hares and darted
into the open door of the light-house.  As they
slammed it to, and slid the bolts, they could hear
a yell of rage from without.
</p>

<p>
As Sandy had surmised, the place was empty.
For the time, at any rate, they were safe.  Moreover,
there was food on the table, and this was
a welcome sight to them.
</p>

<p>
"Queer, isn't it?" asked Sandy, with his mouth
full, "that after taking all that trouble to escape,
we should come back into the light-house after
all."
</p>

<p>
"It certainly is," agreed Jack, likewise eating
hastily.  "Hark!"
</p>

<p>
"Open that door at once, you young varmints!"
</p>

<p>
"I'll break every bone in your bodies when I
get hold of you," roared Walstein.
</p>

<p>
"Let 'em rave," grinned Sandy; "that door will
withstand a siege."
</p>

<p>
"If it's anything like that one upstairs, it will,"
laughed Jack.
</p>

<p>
The lad felt a strange exhilaration.  The feeling
was born of the sense of his wits and his
chum's being pitted against those of the ruffians
outside.  So far, the lads had won out
unmistakably.
</p>

<p>
Walstein began to shout and bellow and pound
on the door, using all sorts of bad language.
</p>

<p>
"Don't swear," shouted Sandy.  "It won't do
you any good.  We're in here, and here we'll
stay."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you will, will you?" struck in another
voice.  It was that of Barkentin.  "We'll see
about that."
</p>

<p>
He gave a peculiar whistle.  It rang shrill and
clear through the night.  The two dogs, on watch
in the upper part of the tower, heard it.  One
of them gave an answering bark.
</p>

<p>
"After 'em, Rex!  Sic 'em, Cæsar!" came
Barkentin's voice.
</p>

<p>
A deep baying howl of peculiar savagery followed.
</p>

<p>
The two lads paled.  Here was a peril they had
quite forgotten.  The two dogs, as they well
knew, were ferocious to a degree.
</p>

<p>
Sandy looked about him.  The most dangerous
weapon in sight was a blunt dinner knife.  The
baying of the dogs grew louder.  The pattering
of their feet could be heard on the inner stairs
of the light-house.
</p>

<p>
"Shut the door!" cried Jack, thinking they
could cut off the stairs in this way.
</p>

<p>
"There isn't one," cried Sandy.
</p>

<p>
"Seize 'em, boys!  Tear 'em, boys!" came
Barkentin's voice from without.
</p>

<p>
The next instant the dogs burst into the room
with savage, gleaming eyes, bristling hackles
and mouths gaping redly.
</p>

<p>
Some big game hunter has said that there is
no more dangerous creature in existence than a
ferocious dog, whether rendered so by training
or disposition.
</p>

<p>
The two that rushed on the boys were Great
Danes, crossed with some fiercer breed, powerful
as panthers, and even more to be dreaded.
</p>

<p>
Sandy snatched up the nearest thing to him&mdash;a
dinner-plate.  He hurled it with full force at
the first dog, as it leaped straight for his throat.
Jack raised a chair and fought desperately with
his antagonist.  Outside came Barkentin's
raucous voice:
</p>

<p>
"Tear 'em, boys!  Seize 'em, boys!"
</p>

<p>
The dogs hesitated for only an instant, as the
boys met their attack.  Then, speedily rallying,
they rushed on them once more, with fangs bared
and dripping, and sharp, white teeth exposed.
</p>

<p>
But the brief interval had given Sandy's sharp
eyes time to observe something.  In one corner of
the room was what appeared to be a trap-door.
Calling to Jack, he made for it, and raised it by
an iron ring affixed to its upper side.  It swung
back, and the two boys flung themselves through
it and slammed it behind them, just as the teeth of
the foremost of the dogs almost closed on Jack
Dacre.
</p>

<p>
The place in which they now found themselves
was pitchy dark.  But Sandy had some matches
in his pocket.  He kindled one, and the light
showed them that they were in an underground
tunnel of some sort.
</p>

<p>
They set off down it at a good speed, not
knowing where it would lead them, but with a wild
desire to leave those two dogs as far behind as
possible.  As they sped along, they could hear
the creatures searching and whining at the
trap-door.
</p>

<p>
The two lads had progressed for some distance&mdash;with
alarming results to Sandy's matches&mdash;when
they came to a door which barred their
further progress.  It was fitted with a bolt, and
after an instant's hesitation, they drew it.
</p>

<p>
As they did so, and the door swung open, a
startling thing happened.  A man rushed out like
a thunderbolt and sprung straight for Sandy.
</p>

<p>
"Take that, you rascal!" he cried.
</p>

<p>
"Hoots mon, what ails ye!" yelled the Scotch
lad, for the flicker of the match had enabled him
to see that the man was gaunt, cadaverous, and
apparently the victim of ill-treatment.  They had
little to fear from him.
</p>

<p>
"Great Scott!" exclaimed the man.  "I know
that voice.  Isn't that a lad named Sandy
MacTavish?"
</p>

<p>
"It is.  But who the dickens are you?  Here,
wait till I get another match."  So saying, the lad
kindled another lucifer.
</p>

<p>
As its light fell on the features of the man
who had sprung out on them, both lads gave an
exclamation of dumfounded amazement:
</p>

<p>
"Sam Hartley!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, it's me, all right!" rejoined the detective,
with scant regard for grammar.  "But what in
the world brings Sandy MacTavish and Jack
Dacre here?"
</p>

<p>
"The same agency which brought you, I
guess," exclaimed Jack; "a band of rascals.  But
tell us what this place is, and how they ever
entrapped you in it."
</p>

<p>
The Secret Service man who had aided the
boys in the valley against the counterfeiters and
again helped them when in peril from Chinese
smugglers in the Great Northwest, soon told his
story.
</p>

<p>
He had been sent out by the Department of
Justice to round up the gang of miscreants that
had been decoying vessels to their fate by false
lights.  As usual, he worked alone, and, disguised
as a fisherman, collected much evidence against
them.  But in some way they came to suspect
him, and one night they raided the hut in which
he had taken up his abode, and made him prisoner.
Ever since then they had kept him a captive,
trying, without success, to get him to reveal
how much evidence he had gathered.
</p>

<p>
"But why didn't the government search for
you?" asked Jack.
</p>

<p>
"Why, they know I always work alone, and
sometimes don't communicate with Washington
for months.  I suppose, in time, they'd have
organized a hunt for me, but by that time, I guess,
there wouldn't have been much of me left to
find."  He held up a skinny arm.
</p>

<p>
"I tell you, the board and lodging at this place
is something fierce," he said, with an attempt to
turn his misery into a joke, in his old cheerful
fashion.
</p>

<p>
"Hark!" exclaimed Jack suddenly.
</p>

<p>
There was good reason for his exclamation.
Even at the depth at which they were located,
they could hear the sounds of firing, as the
furious volleys, of which we know, were leveled at
the submarine.
</p>

<p>
"Something's going on up above," decided Sam
Hartley.  "Wonder what can be up?"
</p>

<p>
"Maybe those rascals are quarreling among
themselves," said Jack.
</p>

<p>
"Let's go back and enter the light-house
through the trap-door," suggested Sandy.
</p>

<p>
But Sam Hartley shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"I know a better way than that," he said.
"You notice that this cell, in which I have been
confined, is merely a section of the tunnel closed
in?"
</p>

<p>
The boys nodded.
</p>

<p>
"You opened the door by which my jailers
brought me food when you slid that outside bolt,"
he said; "but at this other end there's a kind of
a bulkhead.  I succeeded in working it somewhat
loose, but my failing strength would not permit
my proceeding with the job.  But through cracks
in it I've smelled fresh air.  I'm sure it opens
out of doors.  What do you say if we try to force
it by our united efforts?"
</p>

<p>
The bulkhead referred to by Sam Hartley was
an affair of boards and what seemed to be driftwood,
held together by iron braces.  As he had
said, it was in a shaky condition.
</p>

<p>
Together they all three set to work on it, and
after half an hour's work Sandy cried:
</p>

<p>
"Hooray!  One more shove, and down she comes!"
</p>

<p>
The shove was given, and with a will.  As the
Scotch lad had prophesied, the partition fell with
a crash, amid a cloud of dust.  As it fell, a strong
whiff of fresh air blew in their faces.
</p>

<p>
"It's as I thought," declared Sam Hartley,
"this tunnel opens on the lake shore."
</p>

<p>
"Did that rascally gang dig it?" wondered
Sandy.
</p>

<p>
"No," rejoined the detective, "I guess it's of
Indian origin.  There are drawings on the wall.
In one case that I worked up, I had to study such
things, so that I recognize them.  I guess Indians
dug this tunnel, and then the gang, when they
found it, speedily took advantage of the fact that
it was here to make a secret 'getaway' place."
</p>

<p>
As we know, from what old Sam on board the
submarine had said, such was the case.
</p>

<p>
"Well, let's get to the air and find out what's
going forward," said Jack impatiently.
</p>

<p>
The others were nothing loath.  But they found
their way barred by a strange assortment of
encumbrances in the passage-way.  Bales, barrels,
boxes, kegs, all these cluttered it up, almost
to its roof.  It was hard work effecting a
passage among them.
</p>

<p>
"Boys, do you realize what we've stumbled
on?" said Sam Hartley, as they worked at the
task of displacing them.
</p>

<p>
"I guess it's the stuff the gang removed from
vessels they had wrecked," surmised Sandy.
</p>

<p>
"Correct," said Sam.  "Look at the different
names upon them.  They are all of craft that I
have read about as being mysteriously missing."
</p>

<p>
"Well, if you've got a path clear, let's get out,"
said Sandy dryly.  "I've burned my last match."
</p>

<p>
They groped their way forward down the
passage.  Inwardly each was wondering why the
gang did not pursue them.  Had they but known
it, each member of that precious organization
was busied in getting aboard the tug, as it had
been surmised by the rascals that the submarine
would speedily bring the authorities to the island.
</p>

<p>
"Look!  The stars!" cried Jack, as at last they
emerged from the old Indian tunnel upon a sandy
beach.
</p>

<p>
The storm had cleared off like magic, and the
canopy of night sparkled with a thousand points
of light.
</p>

<p>
"Hullo, what's that?" cried Sam suddenly.
</p>

<p>
Something black, and looking not unlike a
whale, had suddenly emerged from the surface
of the waters.
</p>

<p>
"A whale!" cried Sandy.
</p>

<p>
"Rubbish!  What would a whale be doing in
the Great Lakes?" scoffed Jack.
</p>

<p>
"I don't care; it is one."
</p>

<p>
"Look," cried Sam suddenly, "there's a light
coming from it.  It's&mdash;it's&mdash;by all that's
wonderful, it's a submarine!"
</p>

<p>
The rays of the searchlight enveloped the
figures on the beach.  Suddenly the conning tower
hatch shot open and Tom's figure emerged.
</p>

<p>
"Jack!  Jack!" he hailed.
</p>

<p>
"It's Tom!" went up an incredulous shout.
</p>

<p>
Sam Hartley's amazement was no less than
that of the boys.  The submarine's boat was sent
ashore for them, and before long they were all
talking at once in the cabin of the good craft
<i>Huron</i>.  What slappings of the back, hand-shakings
and mad antics ensued, I leave you to imagine.
</p>

<p>
Till dawn they hovered about the island, and
then, as they found that the rascally band had
really escaped, they set out for Brownhaven.  But
a short part of the distance had been covered,
however, before some spars and a hull that looked
familiar were espied.  It was the <i>Sea Ranger</i>.
She proved to have on board Mr. Chisholm Dacre
and Mr. MacTavish.  The gentlemen happened
to be in Buffalo on business when Tom's message
was relayed to them.  In a special train they had
made all speed for Brownhaven, where they had
found the <i>Sea Ranger</i> repaired ahead of the
expected time.  With a hastily picked crew, they
had set out at once for Castle Rock Island.
</p>

<p>
"Well, you boys display a faculty for getting
in and out of trouble far in excess of any I have
ever seen," laughed Mr. Dacre, after they had
formed Obadiah Ironsides' acquaintance and
made a full survey of the marvels of the submarine.
</p>

<p>
"Well, so long as they <i>do</i> get out of it, that's
the main thing," said Mr. MacTavish.  "Such
experiences make real men of them, eh, Mr. Ironsides?"
</p>

<p>
"I think so," said the inventor.
</p>

<p>
The talk then drifted to the finding of the
hidden spoils of the wreckers.
</p>

<p>
In due time, Mr. MacTavish, as owner of the
island, turned these stolen treasures over to the
government, and later he was awarded his share,
which was given over, however, to old Sam, as a
partial recognition of his services.  Both
Mr. Dacre and Mr. MacTavish wished to reward
Mr. Ironsides, but the only recognition of his
assistance in rescuing the lads that the inventor would
take was a letter of introduction from Mr. MacTavish
to an influential naval official at Washington.
It may be said here that this letter was the
ultimate means of his securing a lucrative
contract to build submarines for Uncle Sam's navy.
You have all heard of the Ironsides type of
diving torpedo boat&mdash;the best and most efficient
made.
</p>

<p>
Walstein, Dampier and Co. were eagerly
sought, both by the government and by private
detectives engaged by Mr. Dacre and Mr. MacTavish.
But no trace of them was found, except
a wrecked and abandoned tug on a wild part
of the Canadian shore.  The ruffians escaped into
the wilderness unpunished.
</p>

<p>
As for Castle Rock Island, it has been turned
into a delightful spot.  The old tower once more
beams forth its friendly rays at night, and
nearby a neat bungalow has been built.  The
rest of the island has been turned into a big game
preserve, where the Bungalow Boys delight to
hunt.  The island is a favorite haunt with them
and their boy friends&mdash;and some older ones&mdash;and,
sitting on the veranda of their pleasant island
dwelling, they never tire of conversing about the
stirring days they spent "On the Great Lakes."
</p>

<p>
We should like to relate in detail something of
their happy days on the island, but we must leave
our young friends for a time.  The object of this
present narrative has been fulfilled.  Our boys
have been brought safely through dire perils and
adventures.
</p>

<p>
Those who care to follow still further their
travels may meet them in new surroundings and
novel experiences in a forthcoming volume
dealing with life in Alaska.
</p>

<p>
That land is full of interest and offers abundant
opportunity for adventure, and therefore we
can assure our readers that they will participate
in an exciting tour if they choose to join "The
Bungalow Boys Along the Yukon."

By RICHARD BONNER
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
THE BOY INVENTORS' WIRELESS TELEGRAPH.
</p>

<p>
Blest with natural curiosity,&mdash;sometimes
called the instinct of
investigation,&mdash;favored with golden
opportunity, and gifted with
creative ability, the Boy Inventors
meet emergencies and contrive
mechanical wonders that interest
and convince the reader because
they always "work" when put to
the test.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
THE BOY INVENTORS' VANISHING GUN.
</p>

<p>
A thought, a belief, an experiment; discouragement,
hope, effort and final success&mdash;this is the history of many
an invention; a history in which excitement, competition,
danger, despair and persistence figure.  This merely
suggests the circumstances which draw the daring Boy
Inventors into strange experiences and startling adventures,
and which demonstrate the practical use of their
vanishing gun.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
THE BOY INVENTORS' DIVING TORPEDO BOAT.
</p>

<p>
As in the previous stories of the Boy Inventors, new
and interesting triumphs of mechanism are produced
which become immediately valuable, and the stage for
their proving and testing is again the water.  On the
surface and below it, the boys have jolly, contagious fun,
and the story of their serious, purposeful inventions
challenge the reader's deepest attention.

face in this exciting tale.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
THE BORDER BOYS ACROSS THE FRONTIER.
</p>

<p>
Read of the Haunted Mesa and its
mysteries, of the Subterranean River
and its strange uses, of the value of
gasolene and steam "in running the gauntlet," and you will
feel that not even the ancient splendors of the Old World
can furnish a better setting for romantic action than the
Border of the New.
</p>

<p class="t3b">
THE BORDER BOYS WITH THE MEXICAN RANGERS.
</p>

<p>
As every day is making history&mdash;faster, it is said, than

The Border Boys have already had much excitement

prepare them for the experiences related in this volume.
They are stronger, braver and more resourceful than ever,
and the exigencies of their life in connection with the

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all

used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project

displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
